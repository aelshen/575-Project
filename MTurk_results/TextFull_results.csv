It's been out in the US for quite a while now. It was published in the UK last month with a slightly different cover. My book comes with bonus content inside, including illustrations of some of the characters, and a little cartoon in the back which you shouldn't read if you haven't read the book yet, because it's a bit of a spoiler.<br>In case you don't know what this book is about, it follows Kath and her twin sister Wren as they go to University for the very first time. They've been sharing a bedroom and all of their clothes for their entire life, but now Wren has decided that she doesn't want to be room mates with Kath anymore, so Kath is going to have to deal this whole new world of university all on her own. And with a roommate she doesn't know.<br>Kath is obsessed with the Simon Snow books. There's a seven book series and they've been made into movies, and it becomes quite obvious within the first couple of pages that this is obviously the Harry Potter series. And Kath doesn't just love to read the Simon Snow books, she also writes fan-fiction about two of the male characters, Simon and Baz. And she is quite famous in the fan-fiction world. So she spends most of her time at University writing fan-fiction and not really interacting with the world outside.<br>But she also has to deal with her new roommate, Reagan, who seems to be quite confrontational and doesn't really understand Kath. And then you also have Levi, who's the boy who always hangs out with Reagan and is always around in the room. Kath is also taking a writing class and she's having problems when it comes to original writing versus fan-fiction, and she has to deal with the fact that she's left her dad alone in the house and he doesn't always seem to be able to take care of himself properly.<br>Now it is safe to say that I absolutely adored this book. I already heard  so many people talk about it, and I was like 'How good can it be?' It is that good. It feels so real. So many parts of it, from the kind of romance aspect and the 'he texted me how long should I wait to text him back?', 'he touched my shoulder, what is happening?', to the 'I'm afraid to go to the cafeteria or go visit a professor so I'm just going to walk through the building about five times before doing anything else.'<br>I can't believe that there's a book that has the word 'fan-fiction' on the back of it. In between chapters there are short excerpts from either some of the fan-fiction written by Kath or some of the actual like Simon Snow books. Even though most times it feels really unrelated to the rest of the story, somehow it just fits in really well. I have to say I enjoyed the fan-fiction parts a lot more than the actual bits from the Simon Snow books. It's funny how I can identify with Kath, and people who aren't familiar with fan-fiction can kind of identify with the other characters that find it a bit strange, so there's kind of like a different angle for all kinds of readers.<br>One thing that really bothered me is that, at some point in the story, they reference Harry Potter, and that reference just kind of breaks the entire idea that's been built up here that Simon Snow is actually the Harry Potter series, and I heard someone say this in a review before I'd read the book and I was like 'well it's not that big of a deal', but it really is when you're reading the book.<br>One evening I stayed up until 3AM and finished the second half and cried, because there's so many things in it that are so familiar and it's just a wonderful, wonderful book. I can end this video by saying 'Please go buy Fangirl, and please read it.' I will be encouraging everyone I meet to read this book. Also I've mentioned this before but the illustrations on the cover are by Ginger Hayes. I will put a link to her tumblr in the description because she is amazing.<br>And next up I will definitely be reading Eleanor Park. I hope you enjoyed this review.

It's been out in the US for quite a while now. It was published in the UK last month with a slightly different cover. My book comes with bonus content inside, including illustrations of some of the characters, and a little cartoon in the back which you shouldn't read if you haven't read the book yet, because it's a bit of a spoiler.<br>In case you don't know what this book is about, it follows Kath and her twin sister Wren as they go to University for the very first time. They've been sharing a bedroom and all of their clothes for their entire life, but now Wren has decided that she doesn't want to be room mates with Kath anymore, so Kath is going to have to deal this whole new world of university all on her own. And with a roommate she doesn't know.<br>Kath is obsessed with the Simon Snow books. There's a seven book series and they've been made into movies, and it becomes quite obvious within the first couple of pages that this is obviously the Harry Potter series. And Kath doesn't just love to read the Simon Snow books, she also writes fan-fiction about two of the male characters, Simon and Baz. And she is quite famous in the fan-fiction world. So she spends most of her time at University writing fan-fiction and not really interacting with the world outside.<br>But she also has to deal with her new roommate, Reagan, who seems to be quite confrontational and doesn't really understand Kath. And then you also have Levi, who's the boy who always hangs out with Reagan and is always around in the room. Kath is also taking a writing class and she's having problems when it comes to original writing versus fan-fiction, and she has to deal with the fact that she's left her dad alone in the house and he doesn't always seem to be able to take care of himself properly.<br>Now it is safe to say that I absolutely adored this book. I already heard  so many people talk about it, and I was like 'How good can it be?' It is that good. It feels so real. So many parts of it, from the kind of romance aspect and the 'he texted me how long should I wait to text him back?', 'he touched my shoulder, what is happening?', to the 'I'm afraid to go to the cafeteria or go visit a professor so I'm just going to walk through the building about five times before doing anything else.'<br>I can't believe that there's a book that has the word 'fan-fiction' on the back of it. In between chapters there are short excerpts from either some of the fan-fiction written by Kath or some of the actual like Simon Snow books. Even though most times it feels really unrelated to the rest of the story, somehow it just fits in really well. I have to say I enjoyed the fan-fiction parts a lot more than the actual bits from the Simon Snow books. It's funny how I can identify with Kath, and people who aren't familiar with fan-fiction can kind of identify with the other characters that find it a bit strange, so there's kind of like a different angle for all kinds of readers.<br>One thing that really bothered me is that, at some point in the story, they reference Harry Potter, and that reference just kind of breaks the entire idea that's been built up here that Simon Snow is actually the Harry Potter series, and I heard someone say this in a review before I'd read the book and I was like 'well it's not that big of a deal', but it really is when you're reading the book.<br>One evening I stayed up until 3AM and finished the second half and cried, because there's so many things in it that are so familiar and it's just a wonderful, wonderful book. I can end this video by saying 'Please go buy Fangirl, and please read it.' I will be encouraging everyone I meet to read this book. Also I've mentioned this before but the illustrations on the cover are by Ginger Hayes.

The Archive is described as a library where the dead rest on shelves. The dead are called histories, each one holding the stories of the lives they once lived. A keeper is someone who makes sure that the histories that awake and slip form the Archive are returned.<br>It may sound like an easy task, but it's not. The keepers are faced to deal with histories who are lost and confused and they're often pretty violent. not only is Mackenzie faced with the task of being a keeper, but she's facing moving to a new city, losing her brother and a mystery she feels the need to solve.<br>I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I just cannot stop raving about it. I absolutely adored the main character Mackenzie. She was such a strong character, but at the same time she had her moments of weakness. You could really feel what Mackenzie was going through as she faces change the best she can.<br>I also really enjoyed our supporting character Wesley. I basically loved every scene with him and Mackenzie in it, every conversation they had was really enjoyable. They just made a great duo together and I loved reading their conversations.<br>I also love the character of Roland who is a librarian at the Archive. He had a great relationship with Mackenzie. He kind of acted as a counselor or rather a mentor for Mackenzie, and he just really helped guide her and I just really liked that about him.<br>Throughout this book there are flashbacks between Mackenzie and her grandfather, and some of the flashbacks were some of my favorite parts of the book. It really helped build up this world but not in such a boring way. It was done in a really interesting and unique way.<br>That's something that I love so much about this book was the way that the way the world was built up for you. In some books, when author's build up worlds for you, there's just so much information it can often be just like really boring cuz you're taking in so much information and it's, it's hard to keep up with everything and keep track of what's going on. But Victoria Schwab executed that in such a great way, and really just made sure you understood the world.<br>The plot was so amazing there was so much going on, so many things happening and I almost doubted that the book would tie up everything in the end and that there would probably be this huge cliffhanger and that I'd have to wait for the next book. But that wasn't the case at all. She tied up the book perfectly, and I just can't wait for the next book. I just want it now, I just want it now Victoria Schwab. Can you just give it to me now, huh? How bout that, yea?<br>The writing, can we just talk about the writing? It was perfection. Seriously, this book is so beautifully written. You can really just tell how much work Victoria Schwab put into this book because of how beautifully written it was. I could probably brag about Victoria Schwab all day, on how fantastic the writing was in this book, but I'll just leave it with saying that this book is beautifully written and you need it. You need to pick up this book. You need to go pick up this book because it's fantastic I tell you.<br>I gave this book a 5/5 stars. I bet you weren't guessing that. I seriously love this book, and I think that if you love mystery and you love fantasy that you will really enjoy this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I think that you all need this on your shelf. Also, can we just talk about how beautiful this book is? It's seriously it's so lovely, the insides are amazing too. So good. You need this book on your shelf. You need it.<br>So thanks for watching this guys. I hope that you enjoyed this video and I hope that you go pick up The Archived because you need it. You need this book. Yea, thanks for watching, guys. I will see you tomorrow with the new video and I love ya. To death. I also love this book to death. So, yea.<br>","'avBt9TK6-1c'","21-40|USA","Male","5"

The Archive is described as a library where the dead rest on shelves. The dead are called histories, each one holding the stories of the lives they once lived. A keeper is someone who makes sure that the histories that awake and slip form the Archive are returned.<br>It may sound like an easy task, but it's not. The keepers are faced to deal with histories who are lost and confused and they're often pretty violent. not only is Mackenzie faced with the task of being a keeper, but she's facing moving to a new city, losing her brother and a mystery she feels the need to solve.<br>I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I just cannot stop raving about it. I absolutely adored the main character Mackenzie. She was such a strong character, but at the same time she had her moments of weakness. You could really feel what Mackenzie was going through as she faces change the best she can.<br>I also really enjoyed our supporting character Wesley. I basically loved every scene with him and Mackenzie in it, every conversation they had was really enjoyable. They just made a great duo together and I loved reading their conversations.<br>I also love the character of Roland who is a librarian at the Archive. He had a great relationship with Mackenzie. He kind of acted as a counselor or rather a mentor for Mackenzie, and he just really helped guide her and I just really liked that about him.<br>Throughout this book there are flashbacks between Mackenzie and her grandfather, and some of the flashbacks were some of my favorite parts of the book. It really helped build up this world but not in such a boring way. It was done in a really interesting and unique way.<br>That's something that I love so much about this book was the way that the way the world was built up for you. In some books, when author's build up worlds for you, there's just so much information it can often be just like really boring cuz you're taking in so much information and it's, it's hard to keep up with everything and keep track of what's going on. But Victoria Schwab executed that in such a great way, and really just made sure you understood the world.<br>The plot was so amazing there was so much going on, so many things happening and I almost doubted that the book would tie up everything in the end and that there would probably be this huge cliffhanger and that I'd have to wait for the next book. But that wasn't the case at all. She tied up the book perfectly, and I just can't wait for the next book. I just want it now, I just want it now Victoria Schwab. Can you just give it to me now, huh? How bout that, yea?<br>The writing, can we just talk about the writing? It was perfection. Seriously, this book is so beautifully written. You can really just tell how much work Victoria Schwab put into this book because of how beautifully written it was. I could probably brag about Victoria Schwab all day, on how fantastic the writing was in this book, but I'll just leave it with saying that this book is beautifully written and you need it. You need to pick up this book. You need to go pick up this book because it's fantastic I tell you.<br>I gave this book a 5/5 stars. I bet you weren't guessing that. I seriously love this book, and I think that if you love mystery and you love fantasy that you will really enjoy this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I think that you all need this on your shelf. Also, can we just talk about how beautiful this book is? It's seriously it's so lovely, the insides are amazing too. So good. You need this book on your shelf.

The Archive is described as a library where the dead rest on shelves. The dead are called histories, each one holding the stories of the lives they once lived. A keeper is someone who makes sure that the histories that awake and slip form the Archive are returned.<br>It may sound like an easy task, but it's not. The keepers are faced to deal with histories who are lost and confused and they're often pretty violent. not only is Mackenzie faced with the task of being a keeper, but she's facing moving to a new city, losing her brother and a mystery she feels the need to solve.<br>I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I just cannot stop raving about it. I absolutely adored the main character Mackenzie. She was such a strong character, but at the same time she had her moments of weakness. You could really feel what Mackenzie was going through as she faces change the best she can.<br>I also really enjoyed our supporting character Wesley. I basically loved every scene with him and Mackenzie in it, every conversation they had was really enjoyable. They just made a great duo together and I loved reading their conversations.<br>I also love the character of Roland who is a librarian at the Archive. He had a great relationship with Mackenzie. He kind of acted as a counselor or rather a mentor for Mackenzie, and he just really helped guide her and I just really liked that about him.<br>Throughout this book there are flashbacks between Mackenzie and her grandfather, and some of the flashbacks were some of my favorite parts of the book. It really helped build up this world but not in such a boring way. It was done in a really interesting and unique way.<br>That's something that I love so much about this book was the way that the way the world was built up for you. In some books, when author's build up worlds for you, there's just so much information it can often be just like really boring cuz you're taking in so much information and it's, it's hard to keep up with everything and keep track of what's going on. But Victoria Schwab executed that in such a great way, and really just made sure you understood the world.<br>The plot was so amazing there was so much going on, so many things happening and I almost doubted that the book would tie up everything in the end and that there would probably be this huge cliffhanger and that I'd have to wait for the next book. But that wasn't the case at all. She tied up the book perfectly, and I just can't wait for the next book. I just want it now, I just want it now Victoria Schwab. Can you just give it to me now, huh? How bout that, yea?<br>The writing, can we just talk about the writing? It was perfection. Seriously, this book is so beautifully written. You can really just tell how much work Victoria Schwab put into this book because of how beautifully written it was. I could probably brag about Victoria Schwab all day, on how fantastic the writing was in this book, but I'll just leave it with saying that this book is beautifully written and you need it. You need to pick up this book. You need to go pick up this book because it's fantastic I tell you.<br>I gave this book a 5/5 stars. I bet you weren't guessing that. I seriously love this book, and I think that if you love mystery and you love fantasy that you will really enjoy this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I think that you all need this on your shelf. Also, can we just talk about how beautiful this book is? It's seriously it's so lovely, the insides are amazing too. So good. You need this book on your shelf. You need it.<br>So thanks for watching this guys. I hope that you enjoyed this video and I hope that you go pick up The Archived because you need it. You need this book.

I'm not even gonna try to pronounce it. You guys know how I am about pronouncing things. I'm terrible. OK? So I actually read this book with my good friend Ariel Bisett and she is going to be posting her review about it today as well so I'm gonna leave that in the description when it goes live, and uh yeah you should go check it out because it's gonna be awesome.<br>Why We Broke Up is about the progression and the destruction of a relationship. The book is set up to where you know the outcome of the story, but you're unaware of how the event takes place. This book is a compilation of thoughts and letters from our main character Min. Each chapter starts with an image of an item that represents a reason why they broke up.<br>So let's talk about our main character Min. Min is a character that takes a little time to get used to, and in fact at some points I wasn't sure if I even liked Min. Throughout the beginning of this book Min has a wall up. That sounded like a weird word, wallup. A wall... up. But as the book goes on she lets down her wall and lets you see her for who she is.<br>She reminded me of a know it all film-loving hipster. But I liked that she wasn't perfect and I liked that she was a bit of a snob. I think that sometimes some authors make their characters, or their main characters, speak too perfect as if they're flawless or something, and Min wasn't flawless.<br>Now lets talk about Ed, who is the love interest in this book. To be honest, Ed was a character that we didn't know much about, and it was at times hard to get to know him. All we really knew about him was what Min had to say about him. It all felt very one sided.<br>To me their relationship felt very strange, I know the saying opposites attract, but they were like, complete opposites and it just didn't seem like it was gonna work. Like I said, she's more of a hipster artsy type and he's more of a basketball player jock type. So they were a very interesting mix when they got together as a couple.<br>The thing that I loved most about this book was the writing. The way that Daniel Handler wrote certain things just blew my mind with how beautifully written it was. If anything I would recommend this book because the writing is so brilliant.<br>Another thing that was so amazing about this book is the illustrations throughout the book. Each chapter has an illustration at the beginning of it and the... *swoon* ... the artist did such a good job, it's seriously such a visually pleasing book.<br>I think another thing another thing that made this book so great for me was reading it with Ariel. We would read a certain amount of chapters each day and then come back and talk about it at night. And it just made the reading experience so much more exciting.<br>Overall I gave this book a 5 out of 5 stars. The thing about this book is that it just felt so real to me. Throughout it I just, I felt like I was getting into a relationship, like I was getting in fights with this person, like I was going through a breakup. I literally, my heart, it just began to hurt as they finished their relationship. The emotions I tell you. The emotions. The emotions.<br>I would highly recommend this book it's definitely a page turner, so check it out if you get a chance.<br>","'AzJ6ypiGGG0'","21-40|Germany","Male","4"

I think that sometimes some authors make their characters, or their main characters, speak too perfect as if they're flawless or something, and Min wasn't flawless.<br>Now lets talk about Ed, who is the love interest in this book. To be honest, Ed was a character that we didn't know much about, and it was at times hard to get to know him. All we really knew about him was what Min had to say about him. It all felt very one sided.<br>To me their relationship felt very strange, I know the saying opposites attract, but they were like, complete opposites and it just didn't seem like it was gonna work. Like I said, she's more of a hipster artsy type and he's more of a basketball player jock type. So they were a very interesting mix when they got together as a couple.<br>The thing that I loved most about this book was the writing. The way that Daniel Handler wrote certain things just blew my mind with how beautifully written it was. If anything I would recommend this book because the writing is so brilliant.<br>Another thing that was so amazing about this book is the illustrations throughout the book. Each chapter has an illustration at the beginning of it and the... *swoon* ... the artist did such a good job, it's seriously such a visually pleasing book.<br>I think another thing another thing that made this book so great for me was reading it with Ariel. We would read a certain amount of chapters each day and then come back and talk about it at night. And it just made the reading experience so much more exciting.<br>Overall I gave this book a 5 out of 5 stars. The thing about this book is that it just felt so real to me. Throughout it I just, I felt like I was getting into a relationship, like I was getting in fights with this person, like I was going through a breakup. I literally, my heart, it just began to hurt as they finished their relationship. The emotions I tell you. The emotions. The emotions.<br>I would highly recommend this book it's definitely a page turner, so check it out if you get a chance.<br>","'AzJ6ypiGGG0'","41-60|United States","Female","5"

To be honest, Ed was a character that we didn't know much about, and it was at times hard to get to know him. All we really knew about him was what Min had to say about him. It all felt very one sided.<br>To me their relationship felt very strange, I know the saying opposites attract, but they were like, complete opposites and it just didn't seem like it was gonna work. Like I said, she's more of a hipster artsy type and he's more of a basketball player jock type. So they were a very interesting mix when they got together as a couple.<br>The thing that I loved most about this book was the writing. The way that Daniel Handler wrote certain things just blew my mind with how beautifully written it was. If anything I would recommend this book because the writing is so brilliant.<br>Another thing that was so amazing about this book is the illustrations throughout the book. Each chapter has an illustration at the beginning of it and the... *swoon* ... the artist did such a good job, it's seriously such a visually pleasing book.<br>I think another thing another thing that made this book so great for me was reading it with Ariel. We would read a certain amount of chapters each day and then come back and talk about it at night. And it just made the reading experience so much more exciting.<br>Overall I gave this book a 5 out of 5 stars. The thing about this book is that it just felt so real to me. Throughout it I just, I felt like I was getting into a relationship, like I was getting in fights with this person, like I was going through a breakup. I literally, my heart, it just began to hurt as they finished their relationship. The emotions I tell you. The emotions. The emotions.<br>I would highly recommend this book it's definitely a page turner, so check it out if you get a chance.<br>","'AzJ6ypiGGG0'","21-40|USA","Female","4"

Min is a character that takes a little time to get used to, and in fact at some points I wasn't sure if I even liked Min. Throughout the beginning of this book Min has a wall up. That sounded like a weird word, wallup. A wall... up. But as the book goes on she lets down her wall and lets you see her for who she is.<br>She reminded me of a know it all film-loving hipster.

By the way, that might not be how you're supposed to pronounce the author's name I'm also gonna have a lot of trouble pronouncing the main character's name. So here's my guess: Merslow? Meer? Meersurlow? Meersulow. It's French and I took Spanish in High School.<br>Without giving away the plot, the book focuses on first person narration, through the eyes of Mersault, and divided into two parts. Part 1: everything that leads up to the murder. Part 2: everything that happens after the murder.<br>It's written in a very sparse writing style and my dog won't shut up. Very very similar to the ways of Ernest Hemingway and Fitzgerald.<br>Dear God it's hot. I love the Buffalo Bills.<br>And the book, in this manner, takes on all the philosophical isms you could think of: existentialism, absurdism, naturalism, saturday sit-downism, any ism you can think of people have tried to tack onto this book.<br>But to me, what I see, is the humanizing of the modern psychopath. I mean, think about the emotions, the thoughts that rush into your head when you hear the term psychopath. In the 1980's, even, the top execs in the medical world changed the term to, I believe, anti-social behavioral problem, something along those lines, because of the negative connotations that came with psychopath.<br>But here, Camus is able to gradually massage the psychopath elements of Mersault so slowly into the narrative, that when I read it, I was almost halfway into the book before suddenly it clicked into my head... I get it now.<br>Basically, Mersault is missing the ability to connect on an emotional level with anything around him. And this is what does him in. He can't fully express his feelings, because he doesn't really have that many feelings.<br>What Camus is able to do here, is show us that as easy as it is for us to label somebody as a psychopath, and chuck em into jail, nothing is ever black and white. There's always a grey area.<br>I also love Camus' discussion about free will and the human's ability to adapt to any circumstances given enough time. And Mersault talks about this a couple times in the novel.<br>Mersault goes from being a free man, to being locked into solitary confinement. Think about what that would do to the human soul. Think about what that would take for you mentally to be able to survive. Camus gives us a first person narration of the entire process, step by step. And what he shows us is that you can take away anything from a human, and he's not gonna argue with you that it might not be some of the most painful experiences ever. But he will argue with you that the human spirit can adapt, and in fact, will always adapt given enough time.<br>","'vFvBXuxI50s'","21-40|India","Male","4"

Only fear, desolation, und murder.' Cut to black. That's Wuthering Heights.<br>This is the most depressing novel I've ever read in my life.

I had to read a chapter and then I watched clueless, and then I read a chapter, and then I watched Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, and then I read a chapter, and I watched Heather's -- Heather's probably wasn't the best decision in hindsight.<br>So yea, it's not as good as Jane Eyre, but it's much better than Pride and Prejudice.

The edition I have is a vintage classics edition, it is 545 pages long. Jane Eyre is made up of 2 volumes, and between those volumes there are 38 chapters.<br>I bought this edition honestly about 2 years ago and I've been putting it off ever since. Mainly because, you know, it's quite large, 545 pages, and you know Bronte's, you know, its a classic, you know, sometimes it can be a bit boring, but guys, why didn't I start this sooner.<br>I.. I've never read a book like this. This is a masterpiece of literature.<br>Jane Eyre itself is an autobiography of the fictional character Jane Eyre. The novel begins with Jane Eyre as an orphan, being looked after by her evil Aunt and her annoying cousins. However, soon because Jane is quick tempered and likes to fight back, she's sent off to Lowood, a school for orphans. The school is run by the evil Mr. Brocklehurst, who one day decides to basically take Jane in front of the entire school and tell everyone that she is of the devil and you must not communicate at her and don't even think about being friends with her. However Jane does make friends. She makes friends with a Helen Burns and I'm not going to recount that part of the story because it's too traumatic.<br>However after a period of 8 years Jane finally leaves Lowood. Now she's a teacher and is friends with most of the faculty. She puts an ad out in the local newspaper seeking for a job as a governess and her job application is answered by a Mrs. Fairfax. Jane moves to her new residence at Thornfield hall and looks after a little French girl named Adele until one day she's out walking. A man on a horse rides past her and he falls off. She helps the man back on the horse and tells him that she works in the nearby Thornfield hall. Jane soon finds out that this man is a certain Mr. Edward Fairfax Rochester and that is where the novel begins.<br>I must say, if you have this on your shelf and you're kind of reluctant to read it, you know, it's a Bronte, it's over 500 pages long, guys I read this in 3 days. I couldn't stop reading this book.<br>There are many elements of this novel, there's of course the romance element, there's the teaching element, there's... there's, oddly there's a supernatural element in this as well, which I, eh, very much enjoyed, which I wasn't really expecting.<br>One, tiny tiny tiny tiny downside about this novel: I have absolutely no knowledge of the French language and whenever little Adele, the um little girl that Jane is a governess to, speaks, because she's a french character, all of her dialogue is in French. So I had no idea, throughout the entire novel, what little Adele was saying. Which was kind of annoying.

The school is run by the evil Mr. Brocklehurst, who one day decides to basically take Jane in front of the entire school and tell everyone that she is of the devil and you must not communicate at her and don't even think about being friends with her.

The school is run by the evil Mr. Brocklehurst, who one day decides to basically take Jane in front of the entire school and tell everyone that she is of the devil and you must not communicate at her and don't even think about being friends with her. However Jane does make friends. She makes friends with a Helen Burns and I'm not going to recount that part of the story because it's too traumatic.<br>However after a period of 8 years Jane finally leaves Lowood. Now she's a teacher and is friends with most of the faculty. She puts an ad out in the local newspaper seeking for a job as a governess and her job application is answered by a Mrs. Fairfax. Jane moves to her new residence at Thornfield hall and looks after a little French girl named Adele until one day she's out walking. A man on a horse rides past her and he falls off. She helps the man back on the horse and tells him that she works in the nearby Thornfield hall. Jane soon finds out that this man is a certain Mr. Edward Fairfax Rochester and that is where the novel begins.<br>I must say, if you have this on your shelf and you're kind of reluctant to read it, you know, it's a Bronte, it's over 500 pages long, guys I read this in 3 days.

Harvest is set in a non-specific time and setting, although it's obvious that it was at least a couple of centuries ago. And I'm more used to reading stuff that's set in more recent times; books that are written with language that is perhaps more economical, uh short sentences, to the point, because that's the sort of stuff I like to write as well as read. But Harvest is anything but economical in it's language. It is beautifully written. It is lyrical, it's like reading a giant poem with sentences and stuff. And so within a few pages I'd realized that my initial assumption that I wasn't going to enjoy this book was going to be absolute nonsense, and I really got into it.<br>By the time I got to the end, I actually looked back and thought, crikey, not a lot happened there, but I really enjoyed it, but then I started to think about all the things that had happened, and um I realized there were lots of them.<br>The book is about a village and a group of villagers who've been there for decades, centuries, and this community is completely torn apart over the course of seven days. First of all a group of strangers arrive and the villagers don't take too kindly to their arrival and they blame them for all kinds of things that happen without really looking into the facts. And then things get worse the land owner comes along and decides that they're all gonna have to move out at some point because he's changing the usage of the land to sheep instead of barley.<br>And this makes for a really tight setting, it means that everything that happens, happens in, it seems to me, a few hundred yards, in this very small village, within this very small community, people who've known each other for years and years, who seem to be all related in some way or another.<br>But the novel is really held together by an absolutely brilliant first person narrator. Crace repeatedly fooled me by thinking that he was doing some clever foreshadowing when, the following chapter I would think, well I know what's gonna happen here, but then actually the narrator would then say, 'what I told you earlier on, well I kind of left out a little bit that was quite important and having found this bit out know, you probably think a little less of me.'<br>And one of the important things to note is that the narrator is one of the villagers, but he's only there by marriage. He was actually working for one of the landowners for a number of years, so He's kind of an outsider but he's kind of also within the community as well, and that kind of difficult position is really, it's also torn apart by the events of the novel.<br>So all in all, I love the book. I thought it was a great read. It was quite gripping for a novel set in such a small place without any fireworks and guns going off and stuff like that.<br>It was also quite sinister I found. I found it really quite creepy in places and I think that was probably intentional and that came through both a lack of detail, but also through this lyrical language, the atmosphere that was created. In a way you're led to believe that this village at one point was the most wonderful place in the world to live, with this real tight-knit harmonious community. But as the novel progresses you realize that actually it probably isn't a fantastic place to live at all because, like with most places, they have their history, and they have their memories, and they have all those things that tie us to places in some way or another. And uh, those things are impossible to escape, no matter where you live or what community you may be part of.<br>I haven't read any of the other books on the Booker short list, but I do suspect that this may well win, all the reviews seem to be extremely positive for this book, and therefore that means that it will probably win the Booker Prize, and if not then you should read it anyway. But just read it anyway. You don't have to read a book just cause it's won a prize. Read my book, that's not won a prize.<br>","'2QrAtMFLSj0'","21-40|India","Male","5"

Harvest is set in a non-specific time and setting, although it's obvious that it was at least a couple of centuries ago. And I'm more used to reading stuff that's set in more recent times; books that are written with language that is perhaps more economical, uh short sentences, to the point, because that's the sort of stuff I like to write as well as read. But Harvest is anything but economical in it's language. It is beautifully written. It is lyrical, it's like reading a giant poem with sentences and stuff. And so within a few pages I'd realized that my initial assumption that I wasn't going to enjoy this book was going to be absolute nonsense, and I really got into it.<br>By the time I got to the end, I actually looked back and thought, crikey, not a lot happened there, but I really enjoyed it, but then I started to think about all the things that had happened, and um I realized there were lots of them.<br>The book is about a village and a group of villagers who've been there for decades, centuries, and this community is completely torn apart over the course of seven days. First of all a group of strangers arrive and the villagers don't take too kindly to their arrival and they blame them for all kinds of things that happen without really looking into the facts. And then things get worse the land owner comes along and decides that they're all gonna have to move out at some point because he's changing the usage of the land to sheep instead of barley.<br>And this makes for a really tight setting, it means that everything that happens, happens in, it seems to me, a few hundred yards, in this very small village, within this very small community, people who've known each other for years and years, who seem to be all related in some way or another.<br>But the novel is really held together by an absolutely brilliant first person narrator. Crace repeatedly fooled me by thinking that he was doing some clever foreshadowing when, the following chapter I would think, well I know what's gonna happen here, but then actually the narrator would then say, 'what I told you earlier on, well I kind of left out a little bit that was quite important and having found this bit out know, you probably think a little less of me.'<br>And one of the important things to note is that the narrator is one of the villagers, but he's only there by marriage. He was actually working for one of the landowners for a number of years, so He's kind of an outsider but he's kind of also within the community as well, and that kind of difficult position is really, it's also torn apart by the events of the novel.<br>So all in all, I love the book. I thought it was a great read. It was quite gripping for a novel set in such a small place without any fireworks and guns going off and stuff like that.<br>It was also quite sinister I found. I found it really quite creepy in places and I think that was probably intentional and that came through both a lack of detail, but also through this lyrical language, the atmosphere that was created. In a way you're led to believe that this village at one point was the most wonderful place in the world to live, with this real tight-knit harmonious community.

Harvest is set in a non-specific time and setting, although it's obvious that it was at least a couple of centuries ago. And I'm more used to reading stuff that's set in more recent times; books that are written with language that is perhaps more economical, uh short sentences, to the point, because that's the sort of stuff I like to write as well as read. But Harvest is anything but economical in it's language. It is beautifully written. It is lyrical, it's like reading a giant poem with sentences and stuff.

First of all a group of strangers arrive and the villagers don't take too kindly to their arrival and they blame them for all kinds of things that happen without really looking into the facts.

Crace repeatedly fooled me by thinking that he was doing some clever foreshadowing when, the following chapter I would think, well I know what's gonna happen here, but then actually the narrator would then say, 'what I told you earlier on, well I kind of left out a little bit that was quite important and having found this bit out know, you probably think a little less of me.'<br>And one of the important things to note is that the narrator is one of the villagers, but he's only there by marriage.

And generally this is the kind of book that I don't really go for because I end up feeling worse than I did before I started. By the time I've heard about how creative someone else is, I start to get really upset about my own lack of creativity, and I think well why am I not as productive as they are and how come I'm just sat staring at the window all the time feeling sorry for myself.<br>Well Steal Like an Artist isn't that kind of book, it doesn't make you feel bad about yourself, and in fact, it makes you feel really quite empowered. It doesn't beat you over the head with some kind of productivity stick. Instead it gives you practical, useful things that you can go away and do.<br>I find it fits rather nicely alongside two of the books in mind that I really like. The first one is Rework by Jason Fried and the team at 37 signals. And the other one is The Art of Thinking Sideways by Alan Fletcher. Those books are actually quite different, but they are both inspiring in the sense that they make you want to go away, look at what you do, look at how you work, and make a change. And that was my overriding feeling after reading Steal Like an Artist. Well, this is how I do things now, maybe if I give that a try, I'll do things slightly differently and it's probably better.<br>And in that way the book provided lots of Eureka moments where I was reading along thinking. of course, why have I not done that before. That's a really good idea. That's exactly what I should have been doing for the last, I don't know, 10 or 15 years. So what I thought I'd do is give you my top 3 takeaways. These are the 3 things that I'm doing now that I wasn't doing before I read the book.<br>I'm a writer but you could be a video person, you could be an audio person, you could be a painting person, whatever it is. These 3 things that I'm about to talk about, I think, are gonna be quite useful.<br>Number 1: is start a logbook. So it's like a diary I think, but slightly shorter, but it doesn't have to be that, it could be anything you want it to be, but the idea is to keep a record of what you do everyday, just so you can look back and piece together I guess the fragments of whatever has led you to become wherever you are.<br>In the book it refers to using pen and paper to do this, I've chosen to use the app called day 1. Which is available for the Mac, and for iOS, and I chose that because I can do it basically on the bus on the way home quite easily. Just take out my phone, tippy tap tap, and also because i can take pictures, so I've got the kids I can take pictures of the kids, and say look what we did on this particular day.<br>Number 2, is to have 2 workspaces. An analog workspace and a digital workspace. This is something that I, I've no idea why I've not done this before. But basically, the idea is that you have a space for you computer, and then get rid of the computer and have another space where you just use pen, paper, scissors, post-it notes, whatever you can get your hands on basically. It's a little known fact that A is for Angelica, my novel, was writte, or at least structured, with the use of a wall and postit notes, and so I used to do this all the time. I kind of, I was doing that in one way or another, but I kind of stopped once I finished the novel. It was really useful towards the end to try and piece everything together, but I've no idea why I didn't do that right at the start. So I'm going to. I'm gonna have an analog desk, and a digital desk.<br>And finally, number 3, is to not throw any of yourself away. I don't know if that's the exact expression used in the book. But it's the idea that, we quite easily give things up because we want to do something very specific. So in my case, I want to write a second novel, therefore I very often give up lots of other stuff in my life that I actually quite enjoy. Now part of the reason for this is because I've had twin babies. We know this. But there are other things I've given up and I don't really need to, so I've not played football for example for quite some time, about a year, again it's something I've loved doing for years and years and years. I've also stopped playing videogames, I mean imagine that, and that's something that I did for years and years and years. And I'm not saying that I should be doing those things all the time, cause that is a bit of a problem productivity-wise. But there's no real reason to give up parts of yourself in order to kind of achieve another goal all the time.<br>So the main takeaway there for me is about balance, about trying to find space for other things in your life and not focusing completely on one thing to the detriment of other stuff. And the examples that I used were quite social activities really, but um, it might be a second project or something like that that you want to get going because you working too intensely on whatever it is that you consider your main thing. Having a bit of variety is really important and not giving things up for the sake of it, I think, can be really important as well.<br>So that's really what I wanted to say. It's a fantastic book. Very short. Very easy. You can, you can pop it in your handbag or your satchel or maybe a very large pocket, and I think you'll be very pleased with what you end up getting out of it.<br>","'R-jzd06vSpU'","21-40|INDIA","Female","5"

And generally this is the kind of book that I don't really go for because I end up feeling worse than I did before I started. By the time I've heard about how creative someone else is, I start to get really upset about my own lack of creativity, and I think well why am I not as productive as they are and how come I'm just sat staring at the window all the time feeling sorry for myself.<br>Well Steal Like an Artist isn't that kind of book, it doesn't make you feel bad about yourself, and in fact, it makes you feel really quite empowered. It doesn't beat you over the head with some kind of productivity stick. Instead it gives you practical, useful things that you can go away and do.<br>I find it fits rather nicely alongside two of the books in mind that I really like. The first one is Rework by Jason Fried and the team at 37 signals. And the other one is The Art of Thinking Sideways by Alan Fletcher. Those books are actually quite different, but they are both inspiring in the sense that they make you want to go away, look at what you do, look at how you work, and make a change. And that was my overriding feeling after reading Steal Like an Artist. Well, this is how I do things now, maybe if I give that a try, I'll do things slightly differently and it's probably better.<br>And in that way the book provided lots of Eureka moments where I was reading along thinking. of course, why have I not done that before. That's a really good idea. That's exactly what I should have been doing for the last, I don't know, 10 or 15 years. So what I thought I'd do is give you my top 3 takeaways. These are the 3 things that I'm doing now that I wasn't doing before I read the book.<br>I'm a writer but you could be a video person, you could be an audio person, you could be a painting person, whatever it is. These 3 things that I'm about to talk about, I think, are gonna be quite useful.<br>Number 1: is start a logbook. So it's like a diary I think, but slightly shorter, but it doesn't have to be that, it could be anything you want it to be, but the idea is to keep a record of what you do everyday, just so you can look back and piece together I guess the fragments of whatever has led you to become wherever you are.<br>In the book it refers to using pen and paper to do this, I've chosen to use the app called day 1. Which is available for the Mac, and for iOS, and I chose that because I can do it basically on the bus on the way home quite easily. Just take out my phone, tippy tap tap, and also because i can take pictures, so I've got the kids I can take pictures of the kids, and say look what we did on this particular day.<br>Number 2, is to have 2 workspaces. An analog workspace and a digital workspace. This is something that I, I've no idea why I've not done this before. But basically, the idea is that you have a space for you computer, and then get rid of the computer and have another space where you just use pen, paper, scissors, post-it notes, whatever you can get your hands on basically. It's a little known fact that A is for Angelica, my novel, was writte, or at least structured, with the use of a wall and postit notes, and so I used to do this all the time. I kind of, I was doing that in one way or another, but I kind of stopped once I finished the novel. It was really useful towards the end to try and piece everything together, but I've no idea why I didn't do that right at the start. So I'm going to. I'm gonna have an analog desk, and a digital desk.<br>And finally, number 3, is to not throw any of yourself away. I don't know if that's the exact expression used in the book. But it's the idea that, we quite easily give things up because we want to do something very specific. So in my case, I want to write a second novel, therefore I very often give up lots of other stuff in my life that I actually quite enjoy. Now part of the reason for this is because I've had twin babies. We know this. But there are other things I've given up and I don't really need to, so I've not played football for example for quite some time, about a year, again it's something I've loved doing for years and years and years. I've also stopped playing videogames, I mean imagine that, and that's something that I did for years and years and years. And I'm not saying that I should be doing those things all the time, cause that is a bit of a problem productivity-wise.

So it's like a diary I think, but slightly shorter, but it doesn't have to be that, it could be anything you want it to be, but the idea is to keep a record of what you do everyday, just so you can look back and piece together I guess the fragments of whatever has led you to become wherever you are.<br>In the book it refers to using pen and paper to do this, I've chosen to use the app called day 1. Which is available for the Mac, and for iOS, and I chose that because I can do it basically on the bus on the way home quite easily. Just take out my phone, tippy tap tap, and also because i can take pictures, so I've got the kids I can take pictures of the kids, and say look what we did on this particular day.<br>Number 2, is to have 2 workspaces. An analog workspace and a digital workspace. This is something that I, I've no idea why I've not done this before. But basically, the idea is that you have a space for you computer, and then get rid of the computer and have another space where you just use pen, paper, scissors, post-it notes, whatever you can get your hands on basically. It's a little known fact that A is for Angelica, my novel, was writte, or at least structured, with the use of a wall and postit notes, and so I used to do this all the time. I kind of, I was doing that in one way or another, but I kind of stopped once I finished the novel. It was really useful towards the end to try and piece everything together, but I've no idea why I didn't do that right at the start. So I'm going to. I'm gonna have an analog desk, and a digital desk.<br>And finally, number 3, is to not throw any of yourself away. I don't know if that's the exact expression used in the book. But it's the idea that, we quite easily give things up because we want to do something very specific. So in my case, I want to write a second novel, therefore I very often give up lots of other stuff in my life that I actually quite enjoy. Now part of the reason for this is because I've had twin babies. We know this. But there are other things I've given up and I don't really need to, so I've not played football for example for quite some time, about a year, again it's something I've loved doing for years and years and years. I've also stopped playing videogames, I mean imagine that, and that's something that I did for years and years and years. And I'm not saying that I should be doing those things all the time, cause that is a bit of a problem productivity-wise. But there's no real reason to give up parts of yourself in order to kind of achieve another goal all the time.<br>So the main takeaway there for me is about balance, about trying to find space for other things in your life and not focusing completely on one thing to the detriment of other stuff. And the examples that I used were quite social activities really, but um, it might be a second project or something like that that you want to get going because you working too intensely on whatever it is that you consider your main thing. Having a bit of variety is really important and not giving things up for the sake of it, I think, can be really important as well.<br>So that's really what I wanted to say. It's a fantastic book. Very short. Very easy. You can, you can pop it in your handbag or your satchel or maybe a very large pocket, and I think you'll be very pleased with what you end up getting out of it.<br>","'R-jzd06vSpU'","21-40|USA","Female","4"

And generally this is the kind of book that I don't really go for because I end up feeling worse than I did before I started. By the time I've heard about how creative someone else is, I start to get really upset about my own lack of creativity, and I think well why am I not as productive as they are and how come I'm just sat staring at the window all the time feeling sorry for myself.<br>Well Steal Like an Artist isn't that kind of book, it doesn't make you feel bad about yourself, and in fact, it makes you feel really quite empowered. It doesn't beat you over the head with some kind of productivity stick. Instead it gives you practical, useful things that you can go away and do.<br>I find it fits rather nicely alongside two of the books in mind that I really like. The first one is Rework by Jason Fried and the team at 37 signals. And the other one is The Art of Thinking Sideways by Alan Fletcher. Those books are actually quite different, but they are both inspiring in the sense that they make you want to go away, look at what you do, look at how you work, and make a change.

Danielewski, is about, according to the synopsis, a seamstress recovering from a painful divorce who comes across a storyteller caped in shadow recounting for 5 orphans a tale of unspoken revenge, a harrowing quest, and a terrible sword which everyone soon enough realizes waits before them concealed in a long black box. Which may be accurate I don't know.<br>The book is so confusing to read, that rather than give you my own summary of the book, I'm forced to rely on the book jacket flap synopsis, the way say a dog might be forced to accept its own feces as sustenance during it's owners 2 week cancun vacation.<br>So shame on you, conscious Z. Danielewski, for your probable bender, when you should have been tapping your author guy on the shoulder a bit harder saying, 'hey, uh Mark, uh Marky Z., uh, you sure you wanna write this.' 'But of course.'<br>'You wrote House of Leaves, remember.' 'Yes.' 'House of Leaves, amazing book, that simultaneously destroyed and reconstructed modern storytelling, that house of leaves?' 'mm hmmm.' 'and you think a fitting addition to your cannon, is a fairy tale, told quite unnecessarily as a long-form poem?' 'Absolutely.'<br>'Alright well keep in mind Mark, I'm being pretty generous with the term poem, I just don't want you to rush off to suicide, so I'm trying to inflate this eventual abortion with as much ego stroke and gravitasse as possible, I mean, the book could more accurately be called long-form diarrhea.' 'hmmm.'<br>'So you're aware that this convoluted mess of a book, written obviously to satisfy your need to retain the facade of genius is diarrhea.' 'mm hmm, mm hmmm.'<br>'Oh thank god, oh god OK. I thought you actually thought that, that the 50 year sword was gonna be good, oh wow. OK, OK. So it's all a joke then, and you're not even gonna publish it, right? Right?' 'uhhhh.' 'House of fucking leaves man. Come on.'<br>So even as objectively bad as this book really is, I should have been able to get through it quickly enough to feel as though I didn't waste a whole lot of time, I mean after all it is 95 pages.<br>But wait, half of those pages are blank. No, no, but wait, those pages that have writing on them, only half of the page itself has text. But wait, the book also has illustrations.<br>There's no reason I shouldn't have been able to get through this without feeling as though I didn't waste a little bit of time, unfortunately, I barely got through it. And, unfortunately, I did waste a lot of time.<br>As of today, this book can only be purchased used online because it's been out of print for a while. And signed copies online are right now are selling for about 600 dollars. Signed copies, like this one.<br>Now I assure you I did not spend 600 dollars on this book, I actually paid about 20 for it when it was still in print. Which, yes, is still too much.<br>But for anyone out there who is willing to fork over 600 dollars for this book, I'm willing to sell it. You know, contact me. Even better, I'll actually give you a 100 dollar scratch and dent discount.<br>So, read it or don't read it. Don't read it. I think it gets rerealeased here in october, maybe it'll be for sale at your local bookstore for a fairly reasonable price. Maybe you want it just to add to your collection because, as I've ment- as I alluded to earlier, House of Leaves is a fantastic book. It's one of the best books I've ever read.

Even better, I'll actually give you a 100 dollar scratch and dent discount.<br>So, read it or don't read it. Don't read it. I think it gets rerealeased here in october, maybe it'll be for sale at your local bookstore for a fairly reasonable price. Maybe you want it just to add to your collection because, as I've ment- as I alluded to earlier, House of Leaves is a fantastic book. It's one of the best books I've ever read. I just don't understand how the author then decided to do something like this.<br>","'EgC2YG-BRxs'","21-40|USA","Female","1"

This is a review of the The Fault in Our Stars by John Green. There's probably a lot of you who haven't read it yet, so here's the deal with spoilers. This review is free of any major spoilers. So if you kind know of the basic storyline of the book is, you have absolutely nothing to worry about, but obviously if you don't know anything about this book, and you want to keep it that way, maybe you can save this video to your favorites and come back to it after you finished reading The Fault in Our Stars. I have so many things to say about this book I honestly do not know where to start.<br>The Fault in Our Stars is a story about a sixteen year old girl, called Hazel, who has cancer. When she was diagnosed with cancer when she was fourteen people thought that she was going to die, but through <unintelligible> of medical miracles she survived and now she's in a cancer support group. And that is where she meets Augustus Waters, and Augustus is definitely interested in Hazel.<br>I don't have a copy of the actual book but I had the opportunity to read it early in December and I re-read it again this week. It's been a while since I read a John Green book and I guess I kind of forgotten how much I like them. I think the characters in this book are definitely the best he has written so far.<br>It's kind of a breath of fresh air compared to a lot of other books. They're very much teenagers but at the same time there's a kind of maturity to them, a kind of fullness that I can't really explain but that's so pleasant to have in a book. As in his other books, the dialog is very natural, there's lots of 'likes' and 'whatevers', but at the same time because he mixes in all this literature and poetry it becomes something more elevated than that. There's a very nice balance of, for example, some pranking and some poetry. When I read this for the first time I actually read this in one go, so that's already saying a lot.<br>The book has a female protagonist, which is kind of a new thing for John, and sometimes I couldn't help but hear his voice, probably because I watched the video of John reading the first chapter of his book. I really like how the title of the book works in so many different ways and you keep discovering new ways of interpreting it as you're reading the book. There's so many things that keep coming back as you're reading it.<br>There's this thing about how people treat cancer patients. Of course this book shows that it's, it's very tragic and it's a fight but it also shows that there are jus- they're just teenagers trying to live their lives. There's discussions on death and the way that you choose to make your life have meaning, and meeting your heroes and what happens to characters after a book ends. These are things that will all be very familiar to you if you've been watching John's videos.<br>And then of course there was the Dutch aspect. John's spent about three months in Amsterdam last year so he knows what it's like to be in Amsterdam and that is what makes it so legit. For those of you who don't know I'm dutch, I live in the Netherlands. I live about thirty minutes from Amsterdam by train, and I really like the picture that John paints of Amsterdam. You can tell from the book that he really likes it but I think that most of the things that are in there are completely true.<br>By the way, here's an interesting fact for you: the name of Petyr VonHouton's (sp?) assistant, Lidi VanFlychentart (sp?) was inspired by one of my friend's who also makes videos, and she's called Ligini (sp?), and my last name, which is Flychentart(sp?). So you can imagine that whenever I saw the name I just squealed a little bit. I ordered the audio book that's read by John, so I'm very curious to see how he pronounces the name.<br>Okay, so here's the too-long-didn't-watch version. The Fault in Our Stars is pretty much amazing, I can recommend this to anyone. It's kind of weird cuz it's not like a fun book you can recommend. There's lots of funny things in it but it's not a fun book, but it is very good. Also, to all of you Dutch <unintelligible> there's going to be some very exciting things happening surrounding The Fault in Our Stars in March, so uh get ready for that.<br>So if you hadn't read it, enjoy reading The Fault in Our Stars.

And that is where she meets Augustus Waters, and Augustus is definitely interested in Hazel.<br>I don't have a copy of the actual book but I had the opportunity to read it early in December and I re-read it again this week. It's been a while since I read a John Green book and I guess I kind of forgotten how much I like them. I think the characters in this book are definitely the best he has written so far.<br>It's kind of a breath of fresh air compared to a lot of other books. They're very much teenagers but at the same time there's a kind of maturity to them, a kind of fullness that I can't really explain but that's so pleasant to have in a book. As in his other books, the dialog is very natural, there's lots of 'likes' and 'whatevers', but at the same time because he mixes in all this literature and poetry it becomes something more elevated than that. There's a very nice balance of, for example, some pranking and some poetry. When I read this for the first time I actually read this in one go, so that's already saying a lot.<br>The book has a female protagonist, which is kind of a new thing for John, and sometimes I couldn't help but hear his voice, probably because I watched the video of John reading the first chapter of his book. I really like how the title of the book works in so many different ways and you keep discovering new ways of interpreting it as you're reading the book. There's so many things that keep coming back as you're reading it.<br>There's this thing about how people treat cancer patients. Of course this book shows that it's, it's very tragic and it's a fight but it also shows that there are jus- they're just teenagers trying to live their lives. There's discussions on death and the way that you choose to make your life have meaning, and meeting your heroes and what happens to characters after a book ends. These are things that will all be very familiar to you if you've been watching John's videos.<br>And then of course there was the Dutch aspect. John's spent about three months in Amsterdam last year so he knows what it's like to be in Amsterdam and that is what makes it so legit. For those of you who don't know I'm dutch, I live in the Netherlands. I live about thirty minutes from Amsterdam by train, and I really like the picture that John paints of Amsterdam. You can tell from the book that he really likes it but I think that most of the things that are in there are completely true.<br>By the way, here's an interesting fact for you: the name of Petyr VonHouton's (sp?) assistant, Lidi VanFlychentart (sp?) was inspired by one of my friend's who also makes videos, and she's called Ligini (sp?), and my last name, which is Flychentart(sp?). So you can imagine that whenever I saw the name I just squealed a little bit. I ordered the audio book that's read by John, so I'm very curious to see how he pronounces the name.<br>Okay, so here's the too-long-didn't-watch version. The Fault in Our Stars is pretty much amazing, I can recommend this to anyone. It's kind of weird cuz it's not like a fun book you can recommend. There's lots of funny things in it but it's not a fun book, but it is very good. Also, to all of you Dutch <unintelligible> there's going to be some very exciting things happening surrounding The Fault in Our Stars in March, so uh get ready for that.<br>So if you hadn't read it, enjoy reading The Fault in Our Stars. If you have read it, let me know what you thought about in the comments. I just wanna, I wanna talk to you about this book a lot. I will see you guys later, don't forget to be awesome and best wishes. Doei.<br>","'5i0wDhyjXl8'","21-40|USA","Female","4"

I ordered the audio book that's read by John, so I'm very curious to see how he pronounces the name.<br>Okay, so here's the too-long-didn't-watch version. The Fault in Our Stars is pretty much amazing, I can recommend this to anyone. It's kind of weird cuz it's not like a fun book you can recommend. There's lots of funny things in it but it's not a fun book, but it is very good. Also, to all of you Dutch <unintelligible> there's going to be some very exciting things happening surrounding The Fault in Our Stars in March, so uh get ready for that.<br>So if you hadn't read it, enjoy reading The Fault in Our Stars. If you have read it, let me know what you thought about in the comments. I just wanna, I wanna talk to you about this book a lot. I will see you guys later, don't forget to be awesome and best wishes. Doei.<br>","'5i0wDhyjXl8'","21-40|USA","Male","5"

This is a review of Warm Bodies by Isaac Marion. I picked this up against my better judgment because I found myself rewatching the trailer over and over again. I also picked this book because I really wanted to read a book on my new Kindle Fire and this book wasn't too expensive. And this is what the cover looks like on my Kindle. There was no other way to show you the cover, I had to google an image and pull it up on my Kindle because if you click on the book cover it just becomes the book. eReader struggles. I'm not going to review my Kindle in this video, I'll make a video about that later.<br>Warm Bodies is a debut novel, and there was a pretty interesting description of the author in the front of the book. It says he's not married, has no children and did not go to college or win any prizes. I've watched quite a lot of zombie movies but my only zombie book experience that I've had so far is The Forest of Hands and Teeth which I quite enjoyed, and The Zombie Survival Handbook which I read a couple of years ago. One of the first things that I noticed while I was reading this book is that it has some really cool illustrations. They look like this, which adds something interesting. The book is about a zombie called 'R', who lives in an airport with a bunch of other zombies and the 'bonies', who are a couple of stages further in the whole decomposing process and who seem to run the place. And the story is basically about when he meets a real living girl and takes her home to his plane.<br>I love the airport setting. One of R's favorite hobbies is just going a couple of rounds on the escalator. I really enjoyed that mental image. And as you might imagine, this book depends very heavily on inner-dialog, because R can't get more than two or three words out at a time. I really enjoyed the girl in this story, who's called 'Julie'. She's pretty feisty. She's not afraid to kick some ass, she's not a frightened little bird, but she's still a normal girl. Or, you know, as normal as you can be during a zombie apocalypse.<br>This book had a pretty promising start. I was impressed with the writing. It's borderline YA (Young Adult) but there's some cursing in it. I felt like there was more effort put into the writing than in the general YA novels that are usually more focused on the storyline. There were some sentences and descriptions that I really enjoyed.<br>There was one thing that I didn't like at all. I hate when dreams and visions are one of the main parts of a book, when a storyline relies very heavily on it. One example of that is A Great and Terrible Beauty. I didn't really like that book purely for that reason. In this book, R eats the brain of Julie's boyfriend, and when the zombies eat brains they get to relive some of the memories of that person. I quite like that idea, but then it starts taking up a larger part of the book, and reality and memory get a bit mixed up, and personally I could've done without that part of the story.<br>Other interesting things that I thought about while reading this book is 'What happens when you punch a zombie?' There are descriptions that he gets punched in the face and his jaw breaks. Bone can't fix itself, so you just break your face forever. And then there's a description of zombies having sex, which is the best thing. Apparently, out of habit, they still try to have sex, and they just stand there, naked, trying to rub their bodies together, but it doesn't quite work. So in conclusion, good beginning, interesting premise, a bit weak towards the end. I can definitely recommend this if, for example, you want to read the book before you see the movie, or you really like the zombie genre.<br>In the comments you can let me know if you read the book or if you're planning on seeing the movie. I'll also put a link to the trailer in the description and I will talk to you guys later. Doei.<br>","'TlRagvTsqOI'","21-40|USA","Female","4"

This is a review of Warm Bodies by Isaac Marion. I picked this up against my better judgment because I found myself rewatching the trailer over and over again. I also picked this book because I really wanted to read a book on my new Kindle Fire and this book wasn't too expensive. And this is what the cover looks like on my Kindle. There was no other way to show you the cover, I had to google an image and pull it up on my Kindle because if you click on the book cover it just becomes the book. eReader struggles. I'm not going to review my Kindle in this video, I'll make a video about that later.<br>Warm Bodies is a debut novel, and there was a pretty interesting description of the author in the front of the book. It says he's not married, has no children and did not go to college or win any prizes. I've watched quite a lot of zombie movies but my only zombie book experience that I've had so far is The Forest of Hands and Teeth which I quite enjoyed, and The Zombie Survival Handbook which I read a couple of years ago. One of the first things that I noticed while I was reading this book is that it has some really cool illustrations. They look like this, which adds something interesting. The book is about a zombie called 'R', who lives in an airport with a bunch of other zombies and the 'bonies', who are a couple of stages further in the whole decomposing process and who seem to run the place. And the story is basically about when he meets a real living girl and takes her home to his plane.<br>I love the airport setting. One of R's favorite hobbies is just going a couple of rounds on the escalator. I really enjoyed that mental image. And as you might imagine, this book depends very heavily on inner-dialog, because R can't get more than two or three words out at a time. I really enjoyed the girl in this story, who's called 'Julie'. She's pretty feisty. She's not afraid to kick some ass, she's not a frightened little bird, but she's still a normal girl. Or, you know, as normal as you can be during a zombie apocalypse.<br>This book had a pretty promising start. I was impressed with the writing. It's borderline YA (Young Adult) but there's some cursing in it. I felt like there was more effort put into the writing than in the general YA novels that are usually more focused on the storyline. There were some sentences and descriptions that I really enjoyed.<br>There was one thing that I didn't like at all. I hate when dreams and visions are one of the main parts of a book, when a storyline relies very heavily on it. One example of that is A Great and Terrible Beauty. I didn't really like that book purely for that reason. In this book, R eats the brain of Julie's boyfriend, and when the zombies eat brains they get to relive some of the memories of that person. I quite like that idea, but then it starts taking up a larger part of the book, and reality and memory get a bit mixed up, and personally I could've done without that part of the story.<br>Other interesting things that I thought about while reading this book is 'What happens when you punch a zombie?' There are descriptions that he gets punched in the face and his jaw breaks. Bone can't fix itself, so you just break your face forever. And then there's a description of zombies having sex, which is the best thing. Apparently, out of habit, they still try to have sex, and they just stand there, naked, trying to rub their bodies together, but it doesn't quite work. So in conclusion, good beginning, interesting premise, a bit weak towards the end. I can definitely recommend this if, for example, you want to read the book before you see the movie, or you really like the zombie genre.<br>In the comments you can let me know if you read the book or if you're planning on seeing the movie.

Hi, this is a book review of Bag of Bones by Stephen King, which is where I learned the word vulbine. I have to say, it's quite appropriate for this channel methinks. Anyway this book was given to me by my dad along with several other Stephen King books and I chose to read this one first for several reasons. Number one because I didn't have a clue what it was about. And number 2, because it was I think the shortest novel out of the selection.<br>So what's it about? Well, that's the problem, I don't really know. I got the distinct impression while reading this book that Stephen King himself didn't really know what the story was, so I'm gonna do my best to summarize.<br>We have the main character Mike Nunan, a famous writer and also the narrator of the book. Mike's ex-wife dies unexpectedly at the start of the book, and subsequently Mike then finds himself with severe writer's block. Where it's not just that he can't think of anything to write, it's more that he has a physical reaction whenever he tries to write. He gets incredibly sick and nauseous.<br>In an attempt to combat this, Mike then decides to spend some time at his cottage in the country, which is obviously haunted. While there he meets a young single mum named Mattie Devore, who for some reason everyone in the community just hates her, apart from Mike, who thinks butter wouldn't melt in her mouth.<br>Anyway her father in law is like this super millionaire who tries to gain custody of her daughter, and yea other stuff happens as well.<br>Um, so yeah. I'm at a bit of a loss as to what I can actually tell you about this book, because before I read it, I'd actually heard quite a few good things about, just good reviews in general. I mean Amazon gave it 4 out of 5 stars and goodreads gave it something very close to that. And I'm really struggling to see why.<br>I mean, yeah, the writing's good, it's Stephen King so it's bound to be good. But there just seemed to be too many moments in the story that were completely redundant, like for example the custody case, I don't really see what that had to do with anything. It took up a lot of the book, and I didn't see the point in it.<br>And the whole haunted house aspect seemed to just get lumped in absent-mindedly in an attempt to spice things up a bit because in all honesty this book is so boring.<br>And I do feel bad about saying that because Stephen King is one of my all-time favorite writers, I've said it before, and I will say it again because I've read quite a few of his books. This just didn't live up to expectations and just didn't do it for me.<br>And I can't really be bothered to spend any more time talking about it.<br>So I gave it 2 out of 5 stars.

Today I will be reviewing Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.<br>My edition of Pride and Prejudice is a vintage classics edition, it is 368 pages long and contains 61 chapters.<br>Ok so the basic story of pride and prejudice is, there are the 5 Bennet sisters, and all their mother wants, is for all 5 sisters to be married to wealthy men, and have financial stability, and for them all to live happily ever after.<br>However, as you may guess, this doesn't happen quite as simply as their mother wants it to. But then a wealthy man comes into town, a certain Mr. Bingley with his friend, Mr. Darcy.<br>Now, everybody loves Mr. Bingley. He is charming. He is courageous. He is just the ideal man for any of Mrs. Bennet's daughters, but not that many people like his friend Mr. Darcy, they think he's arrogant, narcissistic, he's very proud and everyone's prejudiced against his pride.<br>The main sister in the novel is Elizabeth Bennet. Elizabeth hates Mr. Darcy so much, she says that she would refuse to ever dance with him... what a bitch.<br>Anyway there's no point in me telling you the story of Pride and Prejudice, everyone knows the story of Pride and Prejudice. You know how it ends. I'm not gonna tell you how it ends, just in case you haven't read this novel, I mean you have had 200 years, so you know, it's kinda your own fault if you read spoilers anywhere.<br>Now, I went into the mindset of this kind of just after reading, uh, Jane Eyre, which I thought was a masterpiece, and I was kinda thinking hey if Jane Eyre shocked me so much why can't one of the most famous novels ever written, you know, shock me as equally.<br>Now, unlike Jane Eyre, Pride and Prejudice did not live up to the hype. To be honest, I found it kind of boring.<br>I don't know if this is the whole, you know, I'm a male thing, because when you think of Pride and Prejudice, you kind of think of, you know, a group of girls sitting around in pajamas eating maltesers and, you know, watching Colin Firth and going, 'Oh Mr. Darcy!'<br>So I didn't really you know play into the whole chicklet kind of aspect of it. I mean, it is the original chicklet when you think about it.<br>I only have one or two criticisms of the novel, not that much, but just things that, I... it just, ugh.<br>OK, there are way, way way way way way too many characters in this novel.<br>I mean J.R.R. Tolkein would be jealous of the amount of characters in this novel. First of all, you go in, you have to learn the 5 sisters names. Right, you learn their names and then you still get mixed up, and then of course, Ms. Austen you know she introduces the names of nearly all of the lords and ladies from the surrounding area, and of course you have to remember which manners they come from as well. And then of course there are all the men of the novel which you must try to remember, and it's just like, oh my lord, I need a list. I need some sort of a list.<br>That's it, I'm not gonna go off on a rant, saying, 'Oh I hate Pride and Prejudice so much,' cause I didn't, right? I liked it. I liked it in moderation.<br>I didn't fly through it like Jane Eyre. It took me about a week. It's about 350 pages. Took me about a week, I kind of took it slowly. I didn't want to fly through it.<br>I personally think, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, the parents, my favorite characters. Mrs. Bennet, is mental.

Elizabeth hates Mr. Darcy so much, she says that she would refuse to ever dance with him... what a bitch.<br>Anyway there's no point in me telling you the story of Pride and Prejudice, everyone knows the story of Pride and Prejudice.

Right, you learn their names and then you still get mixed up, and then of course, Ms. Austen you know she introduces the names of nearly all of the lords and ladies from the surrounding area, and of course you have to remember which manners they come from as well. And then of course there are all the men of the novel which you must try to remember, and it's just like, oh my lord, I need a list. I need some sort of a list.<br>That's it, I'm not gonna go off on a rant, saying, 'Oh I hate Pride and Prejudice so much,' cause I didn't, right? I liked it.

This is a review of Matched by Ally Condie. I borrowed this book from a friend a while back and I read it about one or two months ago. Matched is a book in the tradition of the young adult dystopian novels.<br>The basic premise of this book is that there is this girl called Cassia. She lives in what is called 'society'. Whenever someone turns seventeen they go to this ceremony and they get matched with a potential partner in this is the person that is their perfect partner, and they get married and they have babies and everyone lives happily ever after and basically what this society is trying to do is just make perfect people. People get a certain amount of food and they're only allowed to do a certain amount of exercise. They have a job that fits whatever they're good at, so they live this kind of perfect normal life.<br>When I read about this ceremony that was going to happen, where everyone finds their perfect match, I just though to myself, 'let's guess who will not find a perfect partner, there must be some kind of complication.' I wish that there was some kind of dystopian book where, for some reason, the main character fits perfectly into society. There are some complications with Cassia's matching. There are two boys involved, and it's dramatic and I did not care for that part of the storyline whatsoever.<br>However there were some points of the storyline that I thought were kind of interesting. I believe that the author was a high school English teacher, and there's lots of literature involved in this book. I'm all for intertextuality and references to poetry and novels. What happened in this situation was that the government decided that culture was too cluttered, there were too many things. So they picked a hundred poems, a hundred songs, and a hundred pieces of art. I'm not quite sure what all the categories were, but they picked a hundred of each and destroyed the rest. The thought of that is absolutely horrifying, but it is very interesting to kind of discuss 'which hundred poems would you pick?' It would be impossible to do but I really enjoyed all the references to that in this novel.<br>Another thing that's mentioned in this book is that people never learn how to write because all they do is tap their little keyboards. Cassia secretly learning how to write is also part of the story, which I thought was an interesting thing.<br>There was one scene that really stood out to me, which I finally thought 'Oh! Cassia has a kind of interesting personality', and that was when her brother's crying because he's scared to go to school. He's making a ruckus, which they're not allowed to do. You're not allowed to run or scream. So Cassia tells him that the tablet that they have on which they write all their stuff is actually really fun and you can play lots of games on it. So then she goes through the effort of making up all these games that she can teach her brother in order for to never tell him that she actually kind of lied.<br>Those things I just mentioned to me were kind of the only redeeming qualities of the book. I thought the rest was pretty average, maybe borderline boring. Some of the imagery was so over the top. For example Cassia wears a green dress to the ceremony, and then later there's all these references to green, and instead of it just kind of being mentioned that she sees something green or that something is green, it's mentioned over and over again like 'look, that thing is green. Green like the dress I wore.' It was getting to a point where it was slowly getting you embarrassed for reading this in public, because I felt like people knew what kind of book this was.<br>Final verdict on Matched is that I will not be reading the sequel. I'd say that this book is pretty skippable unless you're really big fan of this whole YA (young adult) dystopian genre and you're gonna want an easy read, then I'd say go for it. Otherwise I think you could possibly skip this one.<br>In the comments you can let me know what you thought about Matched. Maybe you really loved it, tell me what you liked about it, or if you didn't like it tell me what you didn't like. And for those of you who read the sequel maybe you can let me know if it's better or worse than this book. I'll talk to you guys later. Doei.<br>","'yzzexQxoGvQ'","21-40|USA","Female","2"

This is a review of Matched by Ally Condie. I borrowed this book from a friend a while back and I read it about one or two months ago. Matched is a book in the tradition of the young adult dystopian novels.<br>The basic premise of this book is that there is this girl called Cassia. She lives in what is called 'society'. Whenever someone turns seventeen they go to this ceremony and they get matched with a potential partner in this is the person that is their perfect partner, and they get married and they have babies and everyone lives happily ever after and basically what this society is trying to do is just make perfect people. People get a certain amount of food and they're only allowed to do a certain amount of exercise. They have a job that fits whatever they're good at, so they live this kind of perfect normal life.<br>When I read about this ceremony that was going to happen, where everyone finds their perfect match, I just though to myself, 'let's guess who will not find a perfect partner, there must be some kind of complication.' I wish that there was some kind of dystopian book where, for some reason, the main character fits perfectly into society. There are some complications with Cassia's matching. There are two boys involved, and it's dramatic and I did not care for that part of the storyline whatsoever.<br>However there were some points of the storyline that I thought were kind of interesting. I believe that the author was a high school English teacher, and there's lots of literature involved in this book. I'm all for intertextuality and references to poetry and novels. What happened in this situation was that the government decided that culture was too cluttered, there were too many things. So they picked a hundred poems, a hundred songs, and a hundred pieces of art. I'm not quite sure what all the categories were, but they picked a hundred of each and destroyed the rest. The thought of that is absolutely horrifying, but it is very interesting to kind of discuss 'which hundred poems would you pick?' It would be impossible to do but I really enjoyed all the references to that in this novel.<br>Another thing that's mentioned in this book is that people never learn how to write because all they do is tap their little keyboards. Cassia secretly learning how to write is also part of the story, which I thought was an interesting thing.<br>There was one scene that really stood out to me, which I finally thought 'Oh! Cassia has a kind of interesting personality', and that was when her brother's crying because he's scared to go to school. He's making a ruckus, which they're not allowed to do. You're not allowed to run or scream. So Cassia tells him that the tablet that they have on which they write all their stuff is actually really fun and you can play lots of games on it. So then she goes through the effort of making up all these games that she can teach her brother in order for to never tell him that she actually kind of lied.<br>Those things I just mentioned to me were kind of the only redeeming qualities of the book. I thought the rest was pretty average, maybe borderline boring. Some of the imagery was so over the top. For example Cassia wears a green dress to the ceremony, and then later there's all these references to green, and instead of it just kind of being mentioned that she sees something green or that something is green, it's mentioned over and over again like 'look, that thing is green. Green like the dress I wore.' It was getting to a point where it was slowly getting you embarrassed for reading this in public, because I felt like people knew what kind of book this was.<br>Final verdict on Matched is that I will not be reading the sequel. I'd say that this book is pretty skippable unless you're really big fan of this whole YA (young adult) dystopian genre and you're gonna want an easy read, then I'd say go for it. Otherwise I think you could possibly skip this one.<br>In the comments you can let me know what you thought about Matched. Maybe you really loved it, tell me what you liked about it, or if you didn't like it tell me what you didn't like. And for those of you who read the sequel maybe you can let me know if it's better or worse than this book. I'll talk to you guys later. Doei.<br>","'yzzexQxoGvQ'","21-40|india","Male","2"

This is a review of Matched by Ally Condie. I borrowed this book from a friend a while back and I read it about one or two months ago. Matched is a book in the tradition of the young adult dystopian novels.<br>The basic premise of this book is that there is this girl called Cassia. She lives in what is called 'society'. Whenever someone turns seventeen they go to this ceremony and they get matched with a potential partner in this is the person that is their perfect partner, and they get married and they have babies and everyone lives happily ever after and basically what this society is trying to do is just make perfect people. People get a certain amount of food and they're only allowed to do a certain amount of exercise. They have a job that fits whatever they're good at, so they live this kind of perfect normal life.<br>When I read about this ceremony that was going to happen, where everyone finds their perfect match, I just though to myself, 'let's guess who will not find a perfect partner, there must be some kind of complication.' I wish that there was some kind of dystopian book where, for some reason, the main character fits perfectly into society. There are some complications with Cassia's matching. There are two boys involved, and it's dramatic and I did not care for that part of the storyline whatsoever.<br>However there were some points of the storyline that I thought were kind of interesting. I believe that the author was a high school English teacher, and there's lots of literature involved in this book. I'm all for intertextuality and references to poetry and novels. What happened in this situation was that the government decided that culture was too cluttered, there were too many things. So they picked a hundred poems, a hundred songs, and a hundred pieces of art. I'm not quite sure what all the categories were, but they picked a hundred of each and destroyed the rest. The thought of that is absolutely horrifying, but it is very interesting to kind of discuss 'which hundred poems would you pick?' It would be impossible to do but I really enjoyed all the references to that in this novel.<br>Another thing that's mentioned in this book is that people never learn how to write because all they do is tap their little keyboards. Cassia secretly learning how to write is also part of the story, which I thought was an interesting thing.<br>There was one scene that really stood out to me, which I finally thought 'Oh! Cassia has a kind of interesting personality', and that was when her brother's crying because he's scared to go to school. He's making a ruckus, which they're not allowed to do. You're not allowed to run or scream. So Cassia tells him that the tablet that they have on which they write all their stuff is actually really fun and you can play lots of games on it. So then she goes through the effort of making up all these games that she can teach her brother in order for to never tell him that she actually kind of lied.<br>Those things I just mentioned to me were kind of the only redeeming qualities of the book. I thought the rest was pretty average, maybe borderline boring. Some of the imagery was so over the top. For example Cassia wears a green dress to the ceremony, and then later there's all these references to green, and instead of it just kind of being mentioned that she sees something green or that something is green, it's mentioned over and over again like 'look, that thing is green. Green like the dress I wore.' It was getting to a point where it was slowly getting you embarrassed for reading this in public, because I felt like people knew what kind of book this was.<br>Final verdict on Matched is that I will not be reading the sequel. I'd say that this book is pretty skippable unless you're really big fan of this whole YA (young adult) dystopian genre and you're gonna want an easy read, then I'd say go for it. Otherwise I think you could possibly skip this one.<br>In the comments you can let me know what you thought about Matched. Maybe you really loved it, tell me what you liked about it, or if you didn't like it tell me what you didn't like. And for those of you who read the sequel maybe you can let me know if it's better or worse than this book. I'll talk to you guys later. Doei.<br>","'yzzexQxoGvQ'","41-60|United States","Female","2"

This is a review of Player One by Douglas Coupland. This is a book that I randomly picked up at a bookstore. I hadn't heard about this book before, had no previous knowledge about the author, but I really, really enjoyed this book.<br>This is contemporary fiction and I think the first couple of lines on the back of the book describe the storyline best. It says that it's a real-time five hour story set in an airport cocktail lounge during a global disaster. There's a different for each hour and then in these chapters it's separated between the five different points of view. When I read on the back of the book that it was kind of apocalyptic I got very excited because I really like apocalyptic stories. But what I got instead was something that was more about life in general, and about really getting into the head of these characters and the way they think. So I was expecting a bit more plot, but doesn't mean that I was disappointed in this book.<br>It's a story about five people that all somehow end up in this same cocktail lounge in an airport. There's a woman who is meeting up with someone she's kind of dating on the internet. There's this reverend who has stole all the money that his congregation had saved up for I believe a charity. The bartender who works at the cocktail lounge is also one of the characters. There is Rachel who I thought was probably most interesting out of all of them. She had a bit of a Sherlock thing going on as in that she's really intelligent, but she just does not understand humanity, or humans. She doesn't really understand emotions, she looks at everything in a very technical way. She has had normality training, so she knows how to respond to stuff, and seeing things from her head, and then after observing her from a different character's point of view is really awesome.<br>The final character is Player One, who is kind of this mysterious being who is observing everything. While they're in this bar together a kind of really big explosion happens and they try and look on the internet and on tv and don't think that it's completely clear what has happened but the fuel prices are going up and within an hour or something you can't buy fuel anymore so airplanes aren't gonna fly. You don't actually get to see any of this, this is kind of what they hear through the internet and tv. Basically the whole world, or at least the world as far as they can tell is flipping out, so they're stuck in this airport lounge and they're gonna have to deal with things.<br>The back of the book mentioned that this whole style that the book was written in is kind of in the tradition of Kurt Vonnegut and JG Ballard. To me it felt a bit Hitchhiker's Guide-y just in the fact that it explores all these questions that sometimes seem a bit irrelevant or weird but they're very interesting at the same time. The back of the book mentions that this book asks more questions than it answers and that is definitely right, and that's probably one of the most interesting things about this book.<br>I underlined so many things in this book just because there were so many kind of interesting phrases. I like this one, it's the, the woman who's going on the blind date. She says, 'wouldn't it be great if stars turned black during the day? The sky covered with dots like pepper. The crescent moon is visible in the south. Imagine looking up at the moon and seeing it on fire.'<br>There's the bit where the pastor has to deal with all the crazy ladies in his congregation and one woman didn't show up to the meeting and all the other ladies are pissed that she isn't there, and then the pastor says, 'Isn't it funny that the rapture finally happens and the only person to be taken away is Cynthia?' This is the same lady again who says that, 'She once heard that the best thing for the planet would be for everyone to stay in one place for five years. No more transience, no more geographical cures, no more petro holidays. Just a simple commitment to one spot.'<br>To go along with all these fascinating ideas, probably the most interesting part of the book is the future legend at the end of the book. It's about thirty pages and it has all the weird concepts and ideas that are explored in the book, but then in the back kind of as definitions. There's ones that make a lot of sense, and then there are some that are just complete nonsense. 'Capillary Generative Memory: the tendency for history to remember people who invent new hairstyles. For example, Julius Caesar, Albert Einstein, Mariland Monroe, Adolf Hitler and The Beatles.' 'Crazy Uncle syndrome, or for that matter, crazy aunt syndrome: one of the few genuine indicators for success in life is having a few crazy relatives. So long as you only get some of their crazy genes you don't end up being crazy yourself. You merely end up different. And it's that difference that gives you an edge that makes you successful. See also Trainwreck Equilibriation Theory.'<br>Anyways, very interesting book. I would definitely recommend this. I read it on a plane and sitting at an airport next to a kind of cocktail lounge, so that added a bit to the atmosphere. It was not what I expected at first, but it definitely did not disappoint.<br>In the comments you can let me know if you read this book, and if you liked it, and if you have any other books you can recommend by Douglas Coupland, I would definitely be up for that. I will see you guys later. Doei.<br>","'ZIZLyheuu_E'","21-40|USA","Female","4"

I hadn't heard about this book before, had no previous knowledge about the author, but I really, really enjoyed this book.<br>This is contemporary fiction and I think the first couple of lines on the back of the book describe the storyline best. It says that it's a real-time five hour story set in an airport cocktail lounge during a global disaster. There's a different for each hour and then in these chapters it's separated between the five different points of view. When I read on the back of the book that it was kind of apocalyptic I got very excited because I really like apocalyptic stories. But what I got instead was something that was more about life in general, and about really getting into the head of these characters and the way they think. So I was expecting a bit more plot, but doesn't mean that I was disappointed in this book.<br>It's a story about five people that all somehow end up in this same cocktail lounge in an airport. There's a woman who is meeting up with someone she's kind of dating on the internet. There's this reverend who has stole all the money that his congregation had saved up for I believe a charity. The bartender who works at the cocktail lounge is also one of the characters. There is Rachel who I thought was probably most interesting out of all of them. She had a bit of a Sherlock thing going on as in that she's really intelligent, but she just does not understand humanity, or humans. She doesn't really understand emotions, she looks at everything in a very technical way. She has had normality training, so she knows how to respond to stuff, and seeing things from her head, and then after observing her from a different character's point of view is really awesome.<br>The final character is Player One, who is kind of this mysterious being who is observing everything. While they're in this bar together a kind of really big explosion happens and they try and look on the internet and on tv and don't think that it's completely clear what has happened but the fuel prices are going up and within an hour or something you can't buy fuel anymore so airplanes aren't gonna fly. You don't actually get to see any of this, this is kind of what they hear through the internet and tv. Basically the whole world, or at least the world as far as they can tell is flipping out, so they're stuck in this airport lounge and they're gonna have to deal with things.<br>The back of the book mentioned that this whole style that the book was written in is kind of in the tradition of Kurt Vonnegut and JG Ballard. To me it felt a bit Hitchhiker's Guide-y just in the fact that it explores all these questions that sometimes seem a bit irrelevant or weird but they're very interesting at the same time. The back of the book mentions that this book asks more questions than it answers and that is definitely right, and that's probably one of the most interesting things about this book.<br>I underlined so many things in this book just because there were so many kind of interesting phrases. I like this one, it's the, the woman who's going on the blind date. She says, 'wouldn't it be great if stars turned black during the day? The sky covered with dots like pepper. The crescent moon is visible in the south. Imagine looking up at the moon and seeing it on fire.'<br>There's the bit where the pastor has to deal with all the crazy ladies in his congregation and one woman didn't show up to the meeting and all the other ladies are pissed that she isn't there, and then the pastor says, 'Isn't it funny that the rapture finally happens and the only person to be taken away is Cynthia?' This is the same lady again who says that, 'She once heard that the best thing for the planet would be for everyone to stay in one place for five years. No more transience, no more geographical cures, no more petro holidays. Just a simple commitment to one spot.'<br>To go along with all these fascinating ideas, probably the most interesting part of the book is the future legend at the end of the book. It's about thirty pages and it has all the weird concepts and ideas that are explored in the book, but then in the back kind of as definitions. There's ones that make a lot of sense, and then there are some that are just complete nonsense. 'Capillary Generative Memory: the tendency for history to remember people who invent new hairstyles. For example, Julius Caesar, Albert Einstein, Mariland Monroe, Adolf Hitler and The Beatles.' 'Crazy Uncle syndrome, or for that matter, crazy aunt syndrome: one of the few genuine indicators for success in life is having a few crazy relatives. So long as you only get some of their crazy genes you don't end up being crazy yourself. You merely end up different. And it's that difference that gives you an edge that makes you successful. See also Trainwreck Equilibriation Theory.'<br>Anyways, very interesting book. I would definitely recommend this. I read it on a plane and sitting at an airport next to a kind of cocktail lounge, so that added a bit to the atmosphere. It was not what I expected at first, but it definitely did not disappoint.<br>In the comments you can let me know if you read this book, and if you liked it, and if you have any other books you can recommend by Douglas Coupland, I would definitely be up for that. I will see you guys later. Doei.<br>","'ZIZLyheuu_E'","21-40|USA","Female","4"

This is a review of Player One by Douglas Coupland. This is a book that I randomly picked up at a bookstore. I hadn't heard about this book before, had no previous knowledge about the author, but I really, really enjoyed this book.<br>This is contemporary fiction and I think the first couple of lines on the back of the book describe the storyline best. It says that it's a real-time five hour story set in an airport cocktail lounge during a global disaster. There's a different for each hour and then in these chapters it's separated between the five different points of view. When I read on the back of the book that it was kind of apocalyptic I got very excited because I really like apocalyptic stories. But what I got instead was something that was more about life in general, and about really getting into the head of these characters and the way they think. So I was expecting a bit more plot, but doesn't mean that I was disappointed in this book.<br>It's a story about five people that all somehow end up in this same cocktail lounge in an airport. There's a woman who is meeting up with someone she's kind of dating on the internet. There's this reverend who has stole all the money that his congregation had saved up for I believe a charity. The bartender who works at the cocktail lounge is also one of the characters. There is Rachel who I thought was probably most interesting out of all of them. She had a bit of a Sherlock thing going on as in that she's really intelligent, but she just does not understand humanity, or humans. She doesn't really understand emotions, she looks at everything in a very technical way. She has had normality training, so she knows how to respond to stuff, and seeing things from her head, and then after observing her from a different character's point of view is really awesome.<br>The final character is Player One, who is kind of this mysterious being who is observing everything. While they're in this bar together a kind of really big explosion happens and they try and look on the internet and on tv and don't think that it's completely clear what has happened but the fuel prices are going up and within an hour or something you can't buy fuel anymore so airplanes aren't gonna fly. You don't actually get to see any of this, this is kind of what they hear through the internet and tv. Basically the whole world, or at least the world as far as they can tell is flipping out, so they're stuck in this airport lounge and they're gonna have to deal with things.<br>The back of the book mentioned that this whole style that the book was written in is kind of in the tradition of Kurt Vonnegut and JG Ballard. To me it felt a bit Hitchhiker's Guide-y just in the fact that it explores all these questions that sometimes seem a bit irrelevant or weird but they're very interesting at the same time. The back of the book mentions that this book asks more questions than it answers and that is definitely right, and that's probably one of the most interesting things about this book.<br>I underlined so many things in this book just because there were so many kind of interesting phrases. I like this one, it's the, the woman who's going on the blind date. She says, 'wouldn't it be great if stars turned black during the day? The sky covered with dots like pepper. The crescent moon is visible in the south. Imagine looking up at the moon and seeing it on fire.'<br>There's the bit where the pastor has to deal with all the crazy ladies in his congregation and one woman didn't show up to the meeting and all the other ladies are pissed that she isn't there, and then the pastor says, 'Isn't it funny that the rapture finally happens and the only person to be taken away is Cynthia?' This is the same lady again who says that, 'She once heard that the best thing for the planet would be for everyone to stay in one place for five years. No more transience, no more geographical cures, no more petro holidays. Just a simple commitment to one spot.'<br>To go along with all these fascinating ideas, probably the most interesting part of the book is the future legend at the end of the book. It's about thirty pages and it has all the weird concepts and ideas that are explored in the book, but then in the back kind of as definitions. There's ones that make a lot of sense, and then there are some that are just complete nonsense. 'Capillary Generative Memory: the tendency for history to remember people who invent new hairstyles. For example, Julius Caesar, Albert Einstein, Mariland Monroe, Adolf Hitler and The Beatles.' 'Crazy Uncle syndrome, or for that matter, crazy aunt syndrome: one of the few genuine indicators for success in life is having a few crazy relatives. So long as you only get some of their crazy genes you don't end up being crazy yourself. You merely end up different. And it's that difference that gives you an edge that makes you successful. See also Trainwreck Equilibriation Theory.'<br>Anyways, very interesting book. I would definitely recommend this. I read it on a plane and sitting at an airport next to a kind of cocktail lounge, so that added a bit to the atmosphere. It was not what I expected at first, but it definitely did not disappoint.<br>In the comments you can let me know if you read this book, and if you liked it, and if you have any other books you can recommend by Douglas Coupland, I would definitely be up for that. I will see you guys later. Doei.<br>","'ZIZLyheuu_E'","21-40|INDIA","Male","5"

This is my combined book and movie review of Carrie by Stephen King. Let's start out with the book. I read the book before the movie. It is quite a short book to read. Actually, I didn't finish the last two chapters before I saw the movie, which I think was quite good cuz it meant that the ending was a bit of a surprise, and then I could go back and read the last two chapters and figure out what happened in the book.<br>So Carrie is about a girl called 'Carrie White' who has a very religious mother. Carrie is in high school, and she's not popular at all, she gets bullied. One day something really traumatic happens and that even kind of sets her off and she discovers that she has these telekinetic powers. And then one day she gets asked to the prom by a popular guy because one of the girls feels sorry for her. And then at prom they play a prank on her, and everything just gets a little bit out of hand.<br>This was Stephen King's first novel, and as you can see it is quite short. It's one of those very familiar stories where most people I think know what happens to Carrie at prom. But what kind of really shocked me was just the mother is so abusive and so just messed up. You don't really expect to feel sorry for Carrie, you think she's the monster, but while you're reading this you're kind of rooting for Carrie.<br>What's kind of interesting about the writing style of this book is that it is split up into bits form Carrie's point of view, bits from newspaper articles, pieces from like research papers about telekinetic powers and about the incident that happens at the school. So it leaves some gaps in the story, but then at the same time it also provides some extra information that you wouldn't have gotten if it was just from Carrie's point of view.<br>My only issue with this is that as soon as it gets to the kind of prom scenes, you get a lot more interviews and descriptions from other people, and what you wanna know is what's going on in Carrie's head, and it just kind of drags out a lot. The first bits of the book were definitely my favorite. Also didn't think that this book was very scary. I think if you hear about Stephen King book, you assume that it's terrifying because of monsters and blood and murder. But actually this book just kind of makes you really sad and angry. So if you really don't like horror or really scary stories, you can still give Carrie a go.<br>So the movie I watched was the 2013 edition with Chloe Morris and Julianne Moore. First of all I really, really liked the trailer with the slow music and it cutting between the prom scenes and some other scenes. One problem is that the trailer is basically the entire movie, which is what I heard some people complain about, they were at the cinema and they were complaining that they knew the entire story already.<br>What I kind of didn't like as much was the modern setting of it. They bullies were kind of like the sexy, popular girls. They take a video of Carrie and they upload it on youtube and they share it around like that, and what I really liked about the book was the old-fashioned setting. I know that it just wouldn't work for a modern adaptation to be set in that time, so I think obviously they've made the best choice.<br>There were some really disgusting bits in this movie. The mom's just like cutting into her leg and she's like ruining her fingernails by trying to get out of a door. It was really gory and disgusting. More of the parts between Carrie and her mom than the actual parts at Prom.<br>In general I thought that the movie was really fun, it was really interesting to watch, while fun is maybe not the right word. You actually get to see what happens during all the attacks, and you get to be with Carrie. What I really didn't like was the ending. I feel like it was a bit too soft and melodramatic in a way. I really want to watch the older Carrie adaptation as well and see how it compares.<br>In the commentary you can let me know if you've read Carrie or if you've seen the movie and what you thought of them, and I'll see you guys later.

This is my combined book and movie review of Carrie by Stephen King. Let's start out with the book. I read the book before the movie. It is quite a short book to read. Actually, I didn't finish the last two chapters before I saw the movie, which I think was quite good cuz it meant that the ending was a bit of a surprise, and then I could go back and read the last two chapters and figure out what happened in the book.<br>So Carrie is about a girl called 'Carrie White' who has a very religious mother. Carrie is in high school, and she's not popular at all, she gets bullied. One day something really traumatic happens and that even kind of sets her off and she discovers that she has these telekinetic powers. And then one day she gets asked to the prom by a popular guy because one of the girls feels sorry for her. And then at prom they play a prank on her, and everything just gets a little bit out of hand.<br>This was Stephen King's first novel, and as you can see it is quite short. It's one of those very familiar stories where most people I think know what happens to Carrie at prom. But what kind of really shocked me was just the mother is so abusive and so just messed up. You don't really expect to feel sorry for Carrie, you think she's the monster, but while you're reading this you're kind of rooting for Carrie.<br>What's kind of interesting about the writing style of this book is that it is split up into bits form Carrie's point of view, bits from newspaper articles, pieces from like research papers about telekinetic powers and about the incident that happens at the school. So it leaves some gaps in the story, but then at the same time it also provides some extra information that you wouldn't have gotten if it was just from Carrie's point of view.<br>My only issue with this is that as soon as it gets to the kind of prom scenes, you get a lot more interviews and descriptions from other people, and what you wanna know is what's going on in Carrie's head, and it just kind of drags out a lot. The first bits of the book were definitely my favorite. Also didn't think that this book was very scary. I think if you hear about Stephen King book, you assume that it's terrifying because of monsters and blood and murder. But actually this book just kind of makes you really sad and angry. So if you really don't like horror or really scary stories, you can still give Carrie a go.<br>So the movie I watched was the 2013 edition with Chloe Morris and Julianne Moore. First of all I really, really liked the trailer with the slow music and it cutting between the prom scenes and some other scenes. One problem is that the trailer is basically the entire movie, which is what I heard some people complain about, they were at the cinema and they were complaining that they knew the entire story already.<br>What I kind of didn't like as much was the modern setting of it. They bullies were kind of like the sexy, popular girls. They take a video of Carrie and they upload it on youtube and they share it around like that, and what I really liked about the book was the old-fashioned setting. I know that it just wouldn't work for a modern adaptation to be set in that time, so I think obviously they've made the best choice.<br>There were some really disgusting bits in this movie. The mom's just like cutting into her leg and she's like ruining her fingernails by trying to get out of a door. It was really gory and disgusting.

Today we're going to review The Outlander by Diana Gabaldon. Now I er I assume I am announcing that right, 'Gabaldon'. This is an 850 page fiction work, so this is a novel, and it's actually the first in a whole series of novels, umm that she put out. It's her very first book and it started a long series and I'm a little late to the party on this. This was first publish in 1991 by <unintelligible> Books, and so there's been quite a few since, so I've got some catching up to do in terms of my reading.<br>When I started reading it, it's set in 1945 Scotland, so just after World War 2 ends and, I was kind of excited because I have a romantic notion about Scotland and Ireland in that time and in fact I really wanna go there.<br>Denise and I are planning a trip to Paris and London this year, but I'm hoping maybe two years from now to do Scotland and Ireland.<br>So I was really excited, it's set in 1945 Scotland, umm but quickly we time shift, which I wasn't expecting. I didn't know that at all that that's what this novel was about. The main character, Clair Randall, was a nurse during World War 2, during the- the war, and she's now with her husband in Scotland, celebrating a belated anniversary when she goes to this sort of pagan site, and time travels.<br>And she time travels all the way back to 1743, and she meets the other main character in the novel, Jaime Frasier. Now, she also happens to meet one of her husband's ancestors, who's a very bad guy, but this Jaime Frasier she ends up falling in love with. He's quite a bit younger than her and she marries him in 1743. During the whole book we never come back to 1945.<br>It's a very interesting read because once you kind of get into what's happening in 1743, you forget that she's time traveled, except for women have come a long way from 1743 to 1945. So she is constantly running into these issues around people not understanding A)how much she knows about medicine cuz you can imagine a nurse from 1945 knows more than a doctor from 1743 so...<br>I, y'know, for  850 pages general when a book's that long I say uh 'Find yourself a good editor and cut that down.' But actually, there is not a lot of fluff in this, I thought all 850 pages were a great ride. While it starts out a little bit slow, once she time travels, it was one of those books where I just, y'know, 'oh, what time is it? I'll stay up and read one more chapter.' so...<br>I'm really looking forward to the second in the series. I have it, it's in my stack of books to read. Umm, and if you like time travel. If you like period-type books, I think even if you don't like time travel but you like period-type books I think you would really, really enjoy this.<br>Umm, I would definitely recommend it to anybody who likes Phillip McGregory books and those types of read. So yes, Diana Gabaldon, Outlander, and excellent novel and one that I can't wait to follow up with its second book.<br>Thanks so much for watching. Follow me on GoodReads under The Candy Show. You'll see what I'm reading currently and I also will link my book reviews over to my reviews over on GoodReads.

Today we're going to review The Outlander by Diana Gabaldon. Now I er I assume I am announcing that right, 'Gabaldon'. This is an 850 page fiction work, so this is a novel, and it's actually the first in a whole series of novels, umm that she put out. It's her very first book and it started a long series and I'm a little late to the party on this. This was first publish in 1991 by <unintelligible> Books, and so there's been quite a few since, so I've got some catching up to do in terms of my reading.<br>When I started reading it, it's set in 1945 Scotland, so just after World War 2 ends and, I was kind of excited because I have a romantic notion about Scotland and Ireland in that time and in fact I really wanna go there.<br>Denise and I are planning a trip to Paris and London this year, but I'm hoping maybe two years from now to do Scotland and Ireland.<br>So I was really excited, it's set in 1945 Scotland, umm but quickly we time shift, which I wasn't expecting. I didn't know that at all that that's what this novel was about. The main character, Clair Randall, was a nurse during World War 2, during the- the war, and she's now with her husband in Scotland, celebrating a belated anniversary when she goes to this sort of pagan site, and time travels.<br>And she time travels all the way back to 1743, and she meets the other main character in the novel, Jaime Frasier. Now, she also happens to meet one of her husband's ancestors, who's a very bad guy, but this Jaime Frasier she ends up falling in love with. He's quite a bit younger than her and she marries him in 1743. During the whole book we never come back to 1945.<br>It's a very interesting read because once you kind of get into what's happening in 1743, you forget that she's time traveled, except for women have come a long way from 1743 to 1945. So she is constantly running into these issues around people not understanding A)how much she knows about medicine cuz you can imagine a nurse from 1945 knows more than a doctor from 1743 so...<br>I, y'know, for  850 pages general when a book's that long I say uh 'Find yourself a good editor and cut that down.' But actually, there is not a lot of fluff in this, I thought all 850 pages were a great ride. While it starts out a little bit slow, once she time travels, it was one of those books where I just, y'know, 'oh, what time is it? I'll stay up and read one more chapter.' so...<br>I'm really looking forward to the second in the series. I have it, it's in my stack of books to read. Umm, and if you like time travel. If you like period-type books, I think even if you don't like time travel but you like period-type books I think you would really, really enjoy this.<br>Umm, I would definitely recommend it to anybody who likes Phillip McGregory books and those types of read. So yes, Diana Gabaldon, Outlander, and excellent novel and one that I can't wait to follow up with its second book.<br>Thanks so much for watching. Follow me on GoodReads under The Candy Show. You'll see what I'm reading currently and I also will link my book reviews over to my reviews over on GoodReads. And until I see you again, don't drink and drive, where a condom ever time, happy fall, don't cut your thumb off carving the pumpkin and I'll see you the next video.

I didn't know that at all that that's what this novel was about.

He's quite a bit younger than her and she marries him in 1743. During the whole book we never come back to 1945.<br>It's a very interesting read because once you kind of get into what's happening in 1743, you forget that she's time traveled, except for women have come a long way from 1743 to 1945. So she is constantly running into these issues around people not understanding A)how much she knows about medicine cuz you can imagine a nurse from 1945 knows more than a doctor from 1743 so...<br>I, y'know, for  850 pages general when a book's that long I say uh 'Find yourself a good editor and cut that down.' But actually, there is not a lot of fluff in this, I thought all 850 pages were a great ride. While it starts out a little bit slow, once she time travels, it was one of those books where I just, y'know, 'oh, what time is it? I'll stay up and read one more chapter.' so...<br>I'm really looking forward to the second in the series. I have it, it's in my stack of books to read. Umm, and if you like time travel. If you like period-type books, I think even if you don't like time travel but you like period-type books I think you would really, really enjoy this.<br>Umm, I would definitely recommend it to anybody who likes Phillip McGregory books and those types of read. So yes, Diana Gabaldon, Outlander, and excellent novel and one that I can't wait to follow up with its second book.<br>Thanks so much for watching. Follow me on GoodReads under The Candy Show.

Today I'm gonna be reviewing The Maze Runner by James Dashner... Dashner, it is. Again, in my book reviews I do not do any spoilers. I will just be introducing the book and also giving my thoughts on what I thought about the book. Umm, and I will always tell you before a video if I'm going to include spoilers and I will also include it on the title so just to let you guys know.<br>The Maze Runner is about a boy named Thomas who has lost his memory and finds himself in a community of boys living within a maze, this community being called the Glade. Thomas finds himself with loads of questions, wondering how he got in the maze and why he was there. During the day a group of boys called the Runners go out hoping to find a way out of the maze,<br>and during the night when the maze closes, creatures called Groobers come out, and if you're in the maze and the Groobers come out you'll most likely not survive. As the book goes on you learn more about the maze and you learn more about Thomas' purpose for being in the maze. I'm not gonna go on anymore cuz I feel like I could spoil it so easily, so... That's the gist of the story but I promise you it's way more intense than what I'm saying right now because it kind of just sounds silly. Boys... stuck in a maze, trying to find their way out...<br>So let's get on to what I thought about the book. I found this book to be very intriguing, even though at the beginning I found it to be very, very slow. I just really wanted to have my questions answered, but it took forever for a lot of my questions to be answered. And even when they were answered I was still very confused as to what's going on and why they were in the maze.<br>I think it was around chapter 8 when I literally could not put the book down and the story just became very intense, and the story really picked up and begin to develop. I started coming up with theories as to why they were in the maze and how they were going to get out of the maze, which you'll be learning more about that in my discussion videos when I talk about that all of it. But I was completely sucked into the world and I just I felt like I was almost a part of it and I was trying to help them figure it it, which I definitely wasn't.<br>But uh I just really felt like I was a part of the book, and that was really exciting and intense at times. I absolutely loved the style of writing. Umm, James Dashner did a really good job at umm kind of intriguing you and pulling you in and making you want to read the book<br>because the first chapter is just like 'What the heck is going on?' Like I'm not just gonna read the first chapter and not read the second, y'know. So he did a really good job at just like puling you in and getting you to want to figure out why they were in the maze and what was happening and how they were going to get out of the maze.<br>I also loved that the boys had slang words that they used, words like 'clunk' and 'shank'. I just found it funny because in today's world we have so many slang words. I loved most of the characters of the book. There were a few that were on my 'meh' list, but I really enjoyed them. I think that they were realistic characters and they made me believe their frustration and their confusion about the maze.<br>I give The Maze Runner 4/5 stars, just because at the beginning it was very slow, and I really wanted my questions to be answered but they weren't being answered so it was very frustrating. But uhh I really enjoyed this book and I thought it was an excellent read it because it was so good. So I'm adding the Maze Runner to my Must Read Book list. You must read the Maze Runner.<br>I'm really excited to start reading the Scorch Trials which is the second book in this trilogy, uh and uhh I'm hoping it'll be just as good as The Maze Runner, because the epilogue was a 'What the heck' moment and it was a huge cliffhanger and also kind of a curveball and I didn't see it coming. But umm, I'm really excited for The Scorch Trials.<br>So that was my review on The Maze Runner. I hope that you guys liked it and I hope that you guys go pick up The Maze Runner and read it because I really, really enjoyed it. It's a fairly fast read, so you should definitely check it out if you have time for this book.<br>","'El0MAj7hfDc'","21-40|INDIA","Male","5"

I think that they were realistic characters and they made me believe their frustration and their confusion about the maze.<br>I give The Maze Runner 4/5 stars, just because at the beginning it was very slow, and I really wanted my questions to be answered but they weren't being answered so it was very frustrating. But uhh I really enjoyed this book and I thought it was an excellent read it because it was so good. So I'm adding the Maze Runner to my Must Read Book list. You must read the Maze Runner.<br>I'm really excited to start reading the Scorch Trials which is the second book in this trilogy, uh and uhh I'm hoping it'll be just as good as The Maze Runner, because the epilogue was a 'What the heck' moment and it was a huge cliffhanger and also kind of a curveball and I didn't see it coming. But umm, I'm really excited for The Scorch Trials.<br>So that was my review on The Maze Runner. I hope that you guys liked it and I hope that you guys go pick up The Maze Runner and read it because I really, really enjoyed it. It's a fairly fast read, so you should definitely check it out if you have time for this book.<br>","'El0MAj7hfDc'","21-40|india","Male","4"

Umm, and I will always tell you before a video if I'm going to include spoilers and I will also include it on the title so just to let you guys know.<br>The Maze Runner is about a boy named Thomas who has lost his memory and finds himself in a community of boys living within a maze, this community being called the Glade. Thomas finds himself with loads of questions, wondering how he got in the maze and why he was there. During the day a group of boys called the Runners go out hoping to find a way out of the maze,<br>and during the night when the maze closes, creatures called Groobers come out, and if you're in the maze and the Groobers come out you'll most likely not survive.

During the day a group of boys called the Runners go out hoping to find a way out of the maze,<br>and during the night when the maze closes, creatures called Groobers come out, and if you're in the maze and the Groobers come out you'll most likely not survive. As the book goes on you learn more about the maze and you learn more about Thomas' purpose for being in the maze. I'm not gonna go on anymore cuz I feel like I could spoil it so easily, so... That's the gist of the story but I promise you it's way more intense than what I'm saying right now because it kind of just sounds silly. Boys... stuck in a maze, trying to find their way out...<br>So let's get on to what I thought about the book. I found this book to be very intriguing, even though at the beginning I found it to be very, very slow. I just really wanted to have my questions answered, but it took forever for a lot of my questions to be answered. And even when they were answered I was still very confused as to what's going on and why they were in the maze.<br>I think it was around chapter 8 when I literally could not put the book down and the story just became very intense, and the story really picked up and begin to develop. I started coming up with theories as to why they were in the maze and how they were going to get out of the maze, which you'll be learning more about that in my discussion videos when I talk about that all of it. But I was completely sucked into the world and I just I felt like I was almost a part of it and I was trying to help them figure it it, which I definitely wasn't.<br>But uh I just really felt like I was a part of the book, and that was really exciting and intense at times. I absolutely loved the style of writing. Umm, James Dashner did a really good job at umm kind of intriguing you and pulling you in and making you want to read the book<br>because the first chapter is just like 'What the heck is going on?' Like I'm not just gonna read the first chapter and not read the second, y'know. So he did a really good job at just like puling you in and getting you to want to figure out why they were in the maze and what was happening and how they were going to get out of the maze.<br>I also loved that the boys had slang words that they used, words like 'clunk' and 'shank'. I just found it funny because in today's world we have so many slang words. I loved most of the characters of the book. There were a few that were on my 'meh' list, but I really enjoyed them. I think that they were realistic characters and they made me believe their frustration and their confusion about the maze.<br>I give The Maze Runner 4/5 stars, just because at the beginning it was very slow, and I really wanted my questions to be answered but they weren't being answered so it was very frustrating. But uhh I really enjoyed this book and I thought it was an excellent read it because it was so good. So I'm adding the Maze Runner to my Must Read Book list. You must read the Maze Runner.<br>I'm really excited to start reading the Scorch Trials which is the second book in this trilogy, uh and uhh I'm hoping it'll be just as good as The Maze Runner, because the epilogue was a 'What the heck' moment and it was a huge cliffhanger and also kind of a curveball and I didn't see it coming. But umm, I'm really excited for The Scorch Trials.<br>So that was my review on The Maze Runner. I hope that you guys liked it and I hope that you guys go pick up The Maze Runner and read it because I really, really enjoyed it. It's a fairly fast read, so you should definitely check it out if you have time for this book.<br>","'El0MAj7hfDc'","21-40|USA","Female","4"

Today I'm gonna be reviewing The Last Wild by Piers Torday. I received this book from the book depository as a part of their book depository affiliate program. So let's talk about The Last Wild by Piers Torday.<br>The Last Wild is about a boy who's taken from his mother and father to be put into quarantined institution because of a virus that has broken out throughout the world. Our main character James is picked on and bullied in this institution by his peers, and he really just feels misunderstood and really misses his family.<br>He begins to hear voices in his room and he doesn't really know where they're coming from until he realizes that they're coming from little beetles that are crawling throughout his room. This is when he realizes that he has the ability to talk to bugs and animals. The bugs explain to the boy that they are in need of help, and so he ends up breaking out of the institute and helping these animals out. That's what the book is basically about, let's talk about somethings now... Some things in this book.<br>I really liked the main character James, and I felt for him. But at the same time there was a lack of character development and I felt like I was expected to fully understand him, fully understand his struggles right off the bat, and that was really hard for me to just jump in and be like 'okay. This is how he's feeling, I'm supposed to understand why he feels this way.'<br>I thought the story overall was really unique and fascinating and it was full of action and suspense and it was just really an exciting book. But the main thing that I have a problem with was the writing style, I didn't really enjoy it, it was kind of hard to follow at times, and it just didn't really think it was very well done, and it kind of caused me not to enjoy the story as much as I would have if it was written better. I'm not saying that this author is a terrible writer, but I think it could have been done better.<br>I ended up giving this book a 3/5 stars. If you're wanting a fun children's book that's really intense and fun and exciting, then definitely check out this book. I will leave a link to where you can buy this on the book depository's website. You should definitely check it out if you get the chance to.

I'm not saying that this author is a terrible writer, but I think it could have been done better.<br>I ended up giving this book a 3/5 stars. If you're wanting a fun children's book that's really intense and fun and exciting, then definitely check out this book.

Today I'm gonna be reviewing The Last Wild by Piers Torday. I received this book from the book depository as a part of their book depository affiliate program. So let's talk about The Last Wild by Piers Torday.<br>The Last Wild is about a boy who's taken from his mother and father to be put into quarantined institution because of a virus that has broken out throughout the world. Our main character James is picked on and bullied in this institution by his peers, and he really just feels misunderstood and really misses his family.<br>He begins to hear voices in his room and he doesn't really know where they're coming from until he realizes that they're coming from little beetles that are crawling throughout his room. This is when he realizes that he has the ability to talk to bugs and animals. The bugs explain to the boy that they are in need of help, and so he ends up breaking out of the institute and helping these animals out. That's what the book is basically about, let's talk about somethings now... Some things in this book.<br>I really liked the main character James, and I felt for him. But at the same time there was a lack of character development and I felt like I was expected to fully understand him, fully understand his struggles right off the bat, and that was really hard for me to just jump in and be like 'okay. This is how he's feeling, I'm supposed to understand why he feels this way.'<br>I thought the story overall was really unique and fascinating and it was full of action and suspense and it was just really an exciting book.
