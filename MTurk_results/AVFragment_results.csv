This is a review of Warm Bodies by Isaac Marion. I picked this up against my better judgment because I found myself rewatching the trailer over and over again. I also picked this book because I really wanted to read a book on my new Kindle Fire and this book wasn't too expensive. And this is what the cover looks like on my Kindle. There was no other way to show you the cover, I had to google an image and pull it up on my Kindle because if you click on the book cover it just becomes the book. eReader struggles. I'm not going to review my Kindle in this video, I'll make a video about that later.","'TlRagvTsqOI'","12.2","52","71","It's written in a very sparse writing style and my dog won't shut up. Very very similar to the ways of Ernest Hemingway and Fitzgerald.","'vFvBXuxI50s'","16.3","73","91","And in that way the book provided lots of Eureka moments where I was reading along thinking. of course, why have I not done that before. That's a really good idea. That's exactly what I should have been doing for the last, I don't know, 10 or 15 years. So what I thought I'd do is give you my top 3 takeaways. These are the 3 things that I'm doing now that I wasn't doing before I read the book.","'R-jzd06vSpU'","4.3","115","127","Another thing that's mentioned in this book is that people never learn how to write because all they do is tap their little keyboards. Cassia secretly learning how to write is also part of the story, which I thought was an interesting thing.","'yzzexQxoGvQ'","16.1","0","5","This is me heartily recommending that you read Steal Like an Artist by Austin Kleon.","'R-jzd06vSpU'","21-40","india","Female","hi, this review of warm bodies by islamic marion","the book is the stranger albert cambus very very similor","hello every body have a nice day today. going to review about","hi every body, going to review about matched by ally condie","hello every body have a nice day today. going to review about steal like an artist","4","select one","4","4","5"

To me it felt a bit Hitchhiker's Guide-y just in the fact that it explores all these questions that sometimes seem a bit irrelevant or weird but they're very interesting at the same time. The back of the book mentions that this book asks more questions than it answers and that is definitely right, and that's probably one of the most interesting things about this book.","'ZIZLyheuu_E'","35.1","0","29","Vulpine, of or a resembling a fox; cunning or crafty. Hi, this is a book review of Bag of Bones by Stephen King, which is where I learned the word vulbine. I have to say, it's quite appropriate for this channel methinks. Anyway this book was given to me by my dad along with several other Stephen King books and I chose to read this one first for several reasons. Number one because I didn't have a clue what it was about. And number 2, because it was I think the shortest novel out of the selection.","'TOOU7qyUz-c'","7.1","0","36","Hi everybody, this is Candy from The Candy Show and I'm here with another episode of Candy Reads. Today we're going to review The Outlander by Diana Gabaldon. Now I er I assume I am announcing that right, 'Gabaldon'. This is an 850 page fiction work, so this is a novel, and it's actually the first in a whole series of novels, umm that she put out. It's her very first book and it started a long series and I'm a little late to the party on this. This was first publish in 1991 by <unintelligible> Books, and so there's been quite a few since, so I've got some catching up to do in terms of my reading.","'bKnoqnXe4cU'","36.8","202","212","That's it, I'm not gonna go off on a rant, saying, 'Oh I hate Pride and Prejudice so much,' cause I didn't, right?

It doesn't beat you over the head with some kind of productivity stick. Instead it gives you practical, useful things that you can go away and do.","'R-jzd06vSpU'","21-40","india","Female","with in the movements that spoke style","vul.pine stephen bag of bones 1. of or resembling a fox 2. cunning or crafty","everybody welcome to the show","hi like hair dressing and i like everything...","about my self steal like an","4","5","3","4","4"
