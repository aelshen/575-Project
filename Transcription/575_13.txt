Wuthering Heights or Ian Brady and Myra Hindley: The Wonder Years. Hello lovely people how are you today. Today I will be reviewing Wuthering Heights, by Emily Bronte. My edition of Wuthering Heights is a penguin classics edition. It has 337 pages and contains 34 chapters

Where do I even begin to start to describe the, just the black hole that this book left me in.

Ok, imagine a film starring the little girl in the red coat from Schindler's list and Roberto Benigni's character in Life is Beautiful and the entire cast of Requiem for a Dream and the dog from Marley and Me, starring in a film codirected by Michael Haneke, Lars Von Trier, and Darren Aronofsky.

Ok, so the plot of the film, would be that they'd all slowly have to kill each other in tragic circumstances, and at the very end of the film, it just cuts to a large bright white room and it just super zooms up on a face, it is the face of Werner Herzog, and he just looks straight into the camera, and he says, "There ist no God. Only fear, desolation, und murder." Cut to black. That's Wuthering Heights.

This is the most depressing novel I've ever read in my life. I mean I hated every single character, there's not one single real human being in this entire novel.

The people who think this is a love story also probably think that Romeo and Juliet is a love story, because you know most love stories end with double suicide after you know the person for a week.

The odd thing about Wuther Heights, is that it kind of, it crescendos, but then it decrescendos. It kind of you know wooooo [rising and then falling tone]. You know, it kind of, the main thing happens in the center and then it just kind of fizzles out into the depressing.

The first half, you know, it's OK. I like the first half. I could read it, and it was fine, and it was dandy and then the second half came along and the second half is, its... its so depressing. I physically couldn't.

I had to take it segmented. I had to read a chapter and then I watched clueless, and then I read a chapter, and then I watched Romy and Michele's High School Reunion, and then I read a chapter, and I watched Heather's -- Heather's probably wasn't the best decision in hindsight.

So yea, it's not as good as Jane Eyre, but it's much better than Pride and Prejudice. The more I think about Pride and Prejudice the more I just think how incredibly average it is. If you're looking for a, you know a 300 page soul shattering, just mentally torturing, depressing piece of fiction, read Wuthering Heights. You'll never feel happiness again.
