Hey everybody, Dean Goranites here again, and I wanna take you on a magical adventure through the land of books. Todays continent we're gonna visit: psychopaths, murders and death sentences. The Stranger by Albert Camus. By the way, that might not be how you're supposed to pronounce the author's name I'm also gonna have a lot of trouble pronouncing the main character's name. So here's my guess: Merslow? Meer? Meersurlow? Meersulow. It's French and I took Spanish in High School.

Without giving away the plot, the book focuses on first person narration, through the eyes of Mersault, and divided into two parts. Part 1: everything that leads up to the murder. Part 2: everything that happens after the murder.

It's written in a very sparse writing style and my dog won't shut up. Very very similar to the ways of Ernest Hemingway and Fitzgerald.

Dear God it's hot. I love the Buffalo Bills.

And the book, in this manner, takes on all the philosophical isms you could think of: existentialism, absurdism, naturalism, saturday sit-downism, any ism you can think of people have tried to tack onto this book.

But to me, what I see, is the humanizing of the modern psychopath. I mean, think about the emotions, the thoughts that rush into your head when you hear the term psychopath. In the 1980's, even, the top execs in the medical world changed the term to, I believe, anti-social behavioral problem, something along those lines, because of the negative connotations that came with psychopath.

But here, Camus is able to gradually massage the psychopath elements of Mersault so slowly into the narrative, that when I read it, I was almost halfway into the book before suddenly it clicked into my head... I get it now.

Basically, Mersault is missing the ability to connect on an emotional level with anything around him. And this is what does him in. He can't fully express his feelings, because he doesn't really have that many feelings.
#02:53#
What Camus is able to do here, is show us that as easy as it is for us to label somebody as a psychopath, and chuck em into jail, nothing is ever black and white. There's always a grey area.

I also love Camus' discussion about free will and the human's ability to adapt to any circumstances given enough time. And Mersault talks about this a couple times in the novel.
#03:22#
Mersault goes from being a free man, to being locked into solitary confinement. Think about what that would do to the human soul. Think about what that would take for you mentally to be able to survive. Camus gives us a first person narration of the entire process, step by step. And what he shows us is that you can take away anything from a human, and he's not gonna argue with you that it might not be some of the most painful experiences ever. But he will argue with you that the human spirit can adapt, and in fact, will always adapt given enough time.
