Vulpine, of or a resembling a fox; cunning or crafty. Hi, this is a book review of Bag of Bones by Stephen King, which is where I learned the word vulbine. I have to say, it's quite appropriate for this channel methinks. Anyway this book was given to me by my dad along with several other Stephen King books and I chose to read this one first for several reasons. Number one because I didn't have a clue what it was about. And number 2, because it was I think the shortest novel out of the selection.

So what's it about? Well, that's the problem, I don't really know. I got the distinct impression while reading this book that Stephen King himself didn't really know what the story was, so I'm gonna do my best to summarize.

We have the main character Mike Nunan, a famous writer and also the narrator of the book. Mike's ex-wife dies unexpectedly at the start of the book, and subsequently Mike then finds himself with severe writer's block. Where it's not just that he can't think of anything to write, it's more that he has a physical reaction whenever he tries to write. He gets incredibly sick and nauseous.

In an attempt to combat this, Mike then decides to spend some time at his cottage in the country, which is obviously haunted. While there he meets a young single mum named Mattie Devore, who for some reason everyone in the community just hates her, apart from Mike, who thinks butter wouldn't melt in her mouth.

Anyway her father in law is like this super millionaire who tries to gain custody of her daughter, and yea other stuff happens as well.

Um, so yeah. I'm at a bit of a loss as to what I can actually tell you about this book, because before I read it, I'd actually heard quite a few good things about, just good reviews in general. I mean Amazon gave it 4 out of 5 stars and goodreads gave it something very close to that. And I'm really struggling to see why.
#01:54#
I mean, yeah, the writing's good, it's Stephen King so it's bound to be good. But there just seemed to be too many moments in the story that were completely redundant, like for example the custody case, I don't really see what that had to do with anything. It took up a lot of the book, and I didn't see the point in it.
#02:12#
And the whole haunted house aspect seemed to just get lumped in absent-mindedly in an attempt to spice things up a bit because in all honesty this book is so boring.
#02:26#
And I do feel bad about saying that because Stephen King is one of my all-time favorite writers, I've said it before, and I will say it again because I've read quite a few of his books. This just didn't live up to expectations and just didn't do it for me.
#02:39#
And I can't really be bothered to spend any more time talking about it.
#02:42#
So I gave it 2 out of 5 stars.
