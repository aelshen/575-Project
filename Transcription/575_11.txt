So today I'm going to be reviewing Why We Broke Up by Daniel Handler, it was illustrated by... this person. I'm not even gonna try to pronounce it. You guys know how I am about pronouncing things. I'm terrible. OK? So I actually read this book with my good friend Ariel Bisett and she is going to be posting her review about it today as well so I'm gonna leave that in the description when it goes live, and uh yeah you should go check it out because it's gonna be awesome.

Why We Broke Up is about the progression and the destruction of a relationship. The book is set up to where you know the outcome of the story, but you're unaware of how the event takes place. This book is a compilation of thoughts and letters from our main character Min. Each chapter starts with an image of an item that represents a reason why they broke up.

So let's talk about our main character Min. Min is a character that takes a little time to get used to, and in fact at some points I wasn't sure if I even liked Min. Throughout the beginning of this book Min has a wall up. That sounded like a weird word, wallup. A wall... up. But as the book goes on she lets down her wall and lets you see her for who she is.

She reminded me of a know it all film-loving hipster. But I liked that she wasn't perfect and I liked that she was a bit of a snob. I think that sometimes some authors make their characters, or their main characters, speak too perfect as if they're flawless or something, and Min wasn't flawless.

Now lets talk about Ed, who is the love interest in this book. To be honest, Ed was a character that we didn't know much about, and it was at times hard to get to know him. All we really knew about him was what Min had to say about him. It all felt very one sided.

To me their relationship felt very strange, I know the saying opposites attract, but they were like, complete opposites and it just didn't seem like it was gonna work. Like I said, she's more of a hipster artsy type and he's more of a basketball player jock type. So they were a very interesting mix when they got together as a couple.

The thing that I loved most about this book was the writing. The way that Daniel Handler wrote certain things just blew my mind with how beautifully written it was. If anything I would recommend this book because the writing is so brilliant.

Another thing that was so amazing about this book is the illustrations throughout the book. Each chapter has an illustration at the beginning of it and the... *swoon* ... the artist did such a good job, it's seriously such a visually pleasing book.

I think another thing another thing that made this book so great for me was reading it with Ariel. We would read a certain amount of chapters each day and then come back and talk about it at night. And it just made the reading experience so much more exciting.

Overall I gave this book a 5 out of 5 stars. The thing about this book is that it just felt so real to me. Throughout it I just, I felt like I was getting into a relationship, like I was getting in fights with this person, like I was going through a breakup. I literally, my heart, it just began to hurt as they finished their relationship. The emotions I tell you. The emotions. The emotions.

I would highly recommend this book it's definitely a page turner, so check it out if you get a chance.
