Hello lovely people, how are you today. Today I will be reviewing Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.
#00:12#
My edition of Pride and Prejudice is a vintage classics edition, it is 368 pages long and contains 61 chapters.
</intro>
#00:24#
Ok so the basic story of pride and prejudice is, there are the 5 Bennet sisters, and all their mother wants, is for all 5 sisters to be married to wealthy men, and have financial stability, and for them all to live happily ever after.
#00:40#
However, as you may guess, this doesn't happen quite as simply as their mother wants it to. But then a wealthy man comes into town, a certain Mr. Bingley with his friend, Mr. Darcy.
#00:54#
Now, everybody loves Mr. Bingley. He is charming. He is courageous. He is just the ideal man for any of Mrs. Bennet's daughters, but not that many people like his friend Mr. Darcy, they think he's arrogant, narcissistic, he's very proud and everyone's prejudiced against his pride.
#01:14#
The main sister in the novel is Elizabeth Bennet. Elizabeth hates Mr. Darcy so much, she says that she would refuse to ever dance with him... what a bitch.
#01:30#
Anyway there's no point in me telling you the story of Pride and Prejudice, everyone knows the story of Pride and Prejudice. You know how it ends. I'm not gonna tell you how it ends, just in case you haven't read this novel, I mean you have had 200 years, so you know, it's kinda your own fault if you read spoilers anywhere.
#01:46#
Now, I went into the mindset of this kind of just after reading, uh, Jane Eyre, which I thought was a masterpiece, and I was kinda thinking hey if Jane Eyre shocked me so much why can't one of the most famous novels ever written, you know, shock me as equally.
#02:03#
Now, unlike Jane Eyre, Pride and Prejudice did not live up to the hype. To be honest, I found it kind of boring.
#02:13#
I don't know if this is the whole, you know, I'm a male thing, because when you think of Pride and Prejudice, you kind of think of, you know, a group of girls sitting around in pajamas eating maltesers and, you know, watching Colin Firth and going, "Oh Mr. Darcy!"
#02:27#
So I didn't really you know play into the whole chicklet kind of aspect of it. I mean, it is the original chicklet when you think about it.
#02:36#
I only have one or two criticisms of the novel, not that much, but just things that, I... it just, ugh.
#02:43#
OK, there are way, way way way way way too many characters in this novel.
#02:50#
I mean J.R.R. Tolkein would be jealous of the amount of characters in this novel. First of all, you go in, you have to learn the 5 sisters names. Right, you learn their names and then you still get mixed up, and then of course, Ms. Austen you know she introduces the names of nearly all of the lords and ladies from the surrounding area, and of course you have to remember which manners they come from as well. And then of course there are all the men of the novel which you must try to remember, and it's just like, oh my lord, I need a list. I need some sort of a list.
#03:22#
That's it, I'm not gonna go off on a rant, saying, "Oh I hate Pride and Prejudice so much," cause I didn't, right? I liked it. I liked it in moderation.
#03:32#
I didn't fly through it like Jane Eyre. It took me about a week. It's about 350 pages. Took me about a week, I kind of took it slowly. I didn't want to fly through it.   
#03:41#
I personally think, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, the parents, my favorite characters. Mrs. Bennet, is mental. And Mr. Bennet is the only sane person in this entire novel.
#03:53#
Anyway, I give Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen, 3 out of 5 stars. It's good. It's not great. It's not brilliant. It's not Jane Eyre, is it. The Brontes may have beaten you Jane.
