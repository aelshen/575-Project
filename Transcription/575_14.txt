Hello and welcome to my review of Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte. The edition I have is a vintage classics edition, it is 545 pages long. Jane Eyre is made up of 2 volumes, and between those volumes there are 38 chapters.

I bought this edition honestly about 2 years ago and I've been putting it off ever since. Mainly because, you know, it's quite large, 545 pages, and you know Bronte's, you know, its a classic, you know, sometimes it can be a bit boring, but guys, why didn't I start this sooner.

I.. I've never read a book like this. This is a masterpiece of literature.

Jane Eyre itself is an autobiography of the fictional character Jane Eyre. The novel begins with Jane Eyre as an orphan, being looked after by her evil Aunt and her annoying cousins. However, soon because Jane is quick tempered and likes to fight back, she's sent off to Lowood, a school for orphans. The school is run by the evil Mr. Brocklehurst, who one day decides to basically take Jane in front of the entire school and tell everyone that she is of the devil and you must not communicate at her and don't even think about being friends with her. However Jane does make friends. She makes friends with a Helen Burns and I'm not going to recount that part of the story because it's too traumatic.

However after a period of 8 years Jane finally leaves Lowood. Now she's a teacher and is friends with most of the faculty. She puts an ad out in the local newspaper seeking for a job as a governess and her job application is answered by a Mrs. Fairfax. Jane moves to her new residence at Thornfield hall and looks after a little French girl named Adele until one day she's out walking. A man on a horse rides past her and he falls off. She helps the man back on the horse and tells him that she works in the nearby Thornfield hall. Jane soon finds out that this man is a certain Mr. Edward Fairfax Rochester and that is where the novel begins.

I must say, if you have this on your shelf and you're kind of reluctant to read it, you know, it's a Bronte, it's over 500 pages long, guys I read this in 3 days. I couldn't stop reading this book.

There are many elements of this novel, there's of course the romance element, there's the teaching element, there's... there's, oddly there's a supernatural element in this as well, which I, eh, very much enjoyed, which I wasn't really expecting.

One, tiny tiny tiny tiny downside about this novel: I have absolutely no knowledge of the French language and whenever little Adele, the um little girl that Jane is a governess to, speaks, because she's a french character, all of her dialogue is in French. So I had no idea, throughout the entire novel, what little Adele was saying. Which was kind of annoying. It didn't really detract from the story at all, but you know, it was kind of like uh, they could have put translations somewhere.

All in all, Jane Eyre is a brilliant book. It is a masterpiece of literature. It is one of the best books that I've ever read. And I give it 5 out of 5 stars.
