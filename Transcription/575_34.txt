Today I wanted to do a book review on the Invisible Man by H.G. Wells. This is a particularly thin book, and a pretty quick read.
</intro>
#00:07#
Something that I found strange about this book is how self aware it is. The author is very clear about being an author and his role as an author. And he even goes so far as to state things like, 'at this point of the story...'
#00:20#
I found the language of this book to be a little frustrating. It's not that it wasn't understandable, but the issue I had was that it seemed like the author was a little prejudiced. First of all, the main character is albino and a serial killer, so what are you trying to say. Hm, Wells? 
#00:33#
Hm? The back of the book discusses briefly sciences power to corrupt. I don't think that it was so much the power of science that led the main character to his undoing. I think it's important to take into account the fact that the main character is an albino. It's entirely plausible that he wanted to not be seen anymore, because when he was seen, he was seen as different and as other.

Sticking with the theme of other, it's strange that Wells put so much emphasis on how stupid some people are and how intelligent others are. You get a kinda feel for Wells' writing style and his tone and his voice and so on, which is lovely. It's very easy to follow.

The book starts, however, with the dumbest possible characters and I don't know if that's a class thing because of the time that it was written. I'm not sure if he simply wanted to pit the lower class country folk against the industriaized city folk.

Either way I found the country bumpkins dialogue to be incredibly difficult to read because kind of like in the Harry Potter J.K. Rowling for whatever reason puts accents right in the text for Hagrid and for any country idiot in this book you get to decipher the accent and it sounds like they're drunk.
#02:09#
I think it's kind of silly and needless and it was quite distracting because I spent a lot of time trying to decipher and also try and say out loud the accent that they were allegedly speaking in.
#02:20#
I think at the time that it was published it definitely would have been considered a thrilling page-turner and to some extent it could still be considered that today. I certainly didn't think it was necessary for him to explain the science behind becoming invisible.
#02:35#
On a thematic level this is a very interesting book and definitely one that will garner a lot of conversation and discussion, but on a narrative level I feel that it kind of gets in its own way.

It is pretty fun to see how people wrote and spoke, maybe, back in the late 1800's, but apart from that I wasn't totally blown away.
