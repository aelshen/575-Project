I hate when dreams and visions are one of the main parts of a book, when a storyline relies very heavily on it. One example of that is A Great and Terrible Beauty. I didn't really like that book purely for that reason. In this book, R eats the brain of Julie's boyfriend, and when the zombies eat brains they get to relive some of the memories of that person. I quite like that idea, but then it starts taking up a larger part of the book, and reality and memory get a bit mixed up, and personally I could've done without that part of the story.",'TlRagvTsqOI',1.4,149,166,"One thing that really bothered me is that, at some point in the story, they reference Harry Potter, and that reference just kind of breaks the entire idea that's been built up here that Simon Snow is actually the Harry Potter series, and I heard someone say this in a review before I'd read the book and I was like 'well it's not that big of a deal', but it really is when you're reading the book.",'FA1JsSytUQE',34.5,140,155,I think at the time that it was published it definitely would have been considered a thrilling page-turner and to some extent it could still be considered that today.

It kind of you know wooooo [rising and then falling tone]. You know, it kind of, the main thing happens in the center and then it just kind of fizzles out into the depressing.",'GHjV4avE88U',11.1,0,43,"So today I'm going to be reviewing Why We Broke Up by Daniel Handler, it was illustrated by... this person. I'm not even gonna try to pronounce it. You guys know how I am about pronouncing things. I'm terrible. OK? So I actually read this book with my good friend Ariel Bisett and she is going to be posting her review about it today as well so I'm gonna leave that in the description when it goes live, and uh yeah you should go check it out because it's gonna be awesome.",'AzJ6ypiGGG0',41-60,USA,Male,,,,,,4,3,select one,3,3,,One or more answers were left blank
