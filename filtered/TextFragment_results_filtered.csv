This is a review of the The Fault in Our Stars by John Green. There's probably a lot of you who haven't read it yet, so here's the deal with spoilers. This review is free of any major spoilers. So if you kind know of the basic storyline of the book is, you have absolutely nothing to worry about, but obviously if you don't know anything about this book, and you want to keep it that way, maybe you can save this video to your favorites and come back to it after you finished reading The Fault in Our Stars.

First of all a group of strangers arrive and the villagers don't take too kindly to their arrival and they blame them for all kinds of things that happen without really looking into the facts. And then things get worse the land owner comes along and decides that they're all gonna have to move out at some point because he's changing the usage of the land to sheep instead of barley.",'2QrAtMFLSj0',16.6,183,215,"And finally, number 3, is to not throw any of yourself away. I don't know if that's the exact expression used in the book. But it's the idea that, we quite easily give things up because we want to do something very specific. So in my case, I want to write a second novel, therefore I very often give up lots of other stuff in my life that I actually quite enjoy. Now part of the reason for this is because I've had twin babies. We know this. But there are other things I've given up and I don't really need to, so I've not played football for example for quite some time, about a year, again it's something I've loved doing for years and years and years.",'R-jzd06vSpU',21-40|india,Female,3,4,5,5,4
