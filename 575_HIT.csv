3.2,74,99,"I love the airport setting. One of R's favorite hobbies is just going a couple of rounds on the escalator. I really enjoyed that mental image. And as you might imagine, this book depends very heavily on inner-dialog, because R can't get more than two or three words out at a time. I really enjoyed the girl in this story, who's called 'Julie'. She's pretty feisty. She's not afraid to kick some ass, she's not a frightened little bird, but she's still a normal girl. Or, you know, as normal as you can be during a zombie apocalypse.",yzzexQxoGvQ,8.4,129,143,"because the first chapter is just like 'What the heck is going on?' Like I'm not just gonna read the first chapter and not read the second, y'know.

The Fault in Our Stars is pretty much amazing, I can recommend this to anyone. It's kind of weird cuz it's not like a fun book you can recommend. There's lots of funny things in it but it's not a fun book, but it is very good. Also, to all of you Dutch <unintelligible> there's going to be some very exciting things happening surrounding The Fault in Our Stars in March, so uh get ready for that.",TlRagvTsqOI,7.5,183,197,"Umm, I would definitely recommend it to anybody who likes Phillip McGregory books and those types of read. So yes, Diana Gabaldon, Outlander, and excellent novel and one that I can't wait to follow up with its second book.",El0MAj7hfDc,6.4,143,164,"What I kind of didn't like as much was the modern setting of it. They bullies were kind of like the sexy, popular girls. They take a video of Carrie and they upload it on youtube and they share it around like that, and what I really liked about the book was the old-fashioned setting. I know that it just wouldn't work for a modern adaptation to be set in that time, so I think obviously they've made the best choice.",bKnoqnXe4cU
4.4,156,193,"Those things I just mentioned to me were kind of the only redeeming qualities of the book. I thought the rest was pretty average, maybe borderline boring. Some of the imagery was so over the top. For example Cassia wears a green dress to the ceremony, and then later there's all these references to green, and instead of it just kind of being mentioned that she sees something green or that something is green, it's mentioned over and over again like 'look, that thing is green. Green like the dress I wore.' It was getting to a point where it was slowly getting you embarrassed for reading this in public, because I felt like people knew what kind of book this was.",ZIZLyheuu_E,9.1,2,17,"Hello there people, you person looking at me.

It was published in the UK last month with a slightly different cover. My book comes with bonus content inside, including illustrations of some of the characters, and a little cartoon in the back which you shouldn't read if you haven't read the book yet, because it's a bit of a spoiler.",5i0wDhyjXl8,6.3,87,122,"My only issue with this is that as soon as it gets to the kind of prom scenes, you get a lot more interviews and descriptions from other people, and what you wanna know is what's going on in Carrie's head, and it just kind of drags out a lot. The first bits of the book were definitely my favorite. Also didn't think that this book was very scary. I think if you hear about Stephen King book, you assume that it's terrifying because of monsters and blood and murder. But actually this book just kind of makes you really sad and angry. So if you really don't like horror or really scary stories, you can still give Carrie a go.",bKnoqnXe4cU,5.4,169,197,"There's the bit where the pastor has to deal with all the crazy ladies in his congregation and one woman didn't show up to the meeting and all the other ladies are pissed that she isn't there, and then the pastor says, 'Isn't it funny that the rapture finally happens and the only person to be taken away is Cynthia?' This is the same lady again who says that, 'She once heard that the best thing for the planet would be for everyone to stay in one place for five years. No more transience, no more geographical cures, no more petro holidays. Just a simple commitment to one spot.'",GfA_NcwkjmU
2.3,93,114,"The book has a female protagonist, which is kind of a new thing for John, and sometimes I couldn't help but hear his voice, probably because I watched the video of John reading the first chapter of his book. I really like how the title of the book works in so many different ways and you keep discovering new ways of interpreting it as you're reading the book. There's so many things that keep coming back as you're reading it.",TlRagvTsqOI,1.2,37,87,"But she also has to deal with her new roommate, Reagan, who seems to be quite confrontational and doesn't really understand Kath. And then you also have Levi, who's the boy who always hangs out with Reagan and is always around in the room. Kath is also taking a writing class and she's having problems when it comes to original writing versus fan-fiction, and she has to deal with the fact that she's left her dad alone in the house and he doesn't always seem to be able to take care of himself properly.",5i0wDhyjXl8,9.3,72,95,"I thought the story overall was really unique and fascinating and it was full of action and suspense and it was just really an exciting book. But the main thing that I have a problem with was the writing style, I didn't really enjoy it, it was kind of hard to follow at times, and it just didn't really think it was very well done, and it kind of caused me not to enjoy the story as much as I would have if it was written better. I'm not saying that this author is a terrible writer, but I think it could have been done better.",avBt9TK6-1c,4.5,210,223,"In the comments you can let me know what you thought about Matched. Maybe you really loved it, tell me what you liked about it, or if you didn't like it tell me what you didn't like.

This review is free of any major spoilers. So if you kind know of the basic storyline of the book is, you have absolutely nothing to worry about, but obviously if you don't know anything about this book, and you want to keep it that way, maybe you can save this video to your favorites and come back to it after you finished reading The Fault in Our Stars. I have so many things to say about this book I honestly do not know where to start.",TlRagvTsqOI,1.4,166,190,"One evening I stayed up until 3AM and finished the second half and cried, because there's so many things in it that are so familiar and it's just a wonderful, wonderful book. I can end this video by saying 'Please go buy Fangirl, and please read it.' I will be encouraging everyone I meet to read this book. Also I've mentioned this before but the illustrations on the cover are by Ginger Hayes. I will put a link to her tumblr in the description because she is amazing.",5i0wDhyjXl8,10.6,152,174,"I gave this book a 5/5 stars. I bet you weren't guessing that. I seriously love this book, and I think that if you love mystery and you love fantasy that you will really enjoy this book. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I think that you all need this on your shelf. Also, can we just talk about how beautiful this book is? It's seriously it's so lovely, the insides are amazing too. So good. You need this book on your shelf. You need it.",AzJ6ypiGGG0,8.5,164,186,"I give The Maze Runner 4/5 stars, just because at the beginning it was very slow, and I really wanted my questions to be answered but they weren't being answered so it was very frustrating. But uhh I really enjoyed this book and I thought it was an excellent read it because it was so good. So I'm adding the Maze Runner to my Must Read Book list. You must read the Maze Runner.",qaqO5nJOnSc,5.3,127,152,"The back of the book mentioned that this whole style that the book was written in is kind of in the tradition of Kurt Vonnegut and JG Ballard. To me it felt a bit Hitchhiker's Guide-y just in the fact that it explores all these questions that sometimes seem a bit irrelevant or weird but they're very interesting at the same time. The back of the book mentions that this book asks more questions than it answers and that is definitely right, and that's probably one of the most interesting things about this book.",GfA_NcwkjmU
4.3,115,127,"Another thing that's mentioned in this book is that people never learn how to write because all they do is tap their little keyboards. Cassia secretly learning how to write is also part of the story, which I thought was an interesting thing.",ZIZLyheuu_E,8.3,90,113,"I think it was around chapter 8 when I literally could not put the book down and the story just became very intense, and the story really picked up and begin to develop. I started coming up with theories as to why they were in the maze and how they were going to get out of the maze, which you'll be learning more about that in my discussion videos when I talk about that all of it.

I picked this up against my better judgment because I found myself rewatching the trailer over and over again. I also picked this book because I really wanted to read a book on my new Kindle Fire and this book wasn't too expensive. And this is what the cover looks like on my Kindle. There was no other way to show you the cover, I had to google an image and pull it up on my Kindle because if you click on the book cover it just becomes the book. eReader struggles.

10.3,56,66,"I also really enjoyed our supporting character Wesley. I basically loved every scene with him and Mackenzie in it, every conversation they had was really enjoyable. They just made a great duo together and I loved reading their conversations.",AzJ6ypiGGG0,5.2,49,93,"It's a story about five people that all somehow end up in this same cocktail lounge in an airport. There's a woman who is meeting up with someone she's kind of dating on the internet. There's this reverend who has stole all the money that his congregation had saved up for I believe a charity. The bartender who works at the cocktail lounge is also one of the characters. There is Rachel who I thought was probably most interesting out of all of them. She had a bit of a Sherlock thing going on as in that she's really intelligent, but she just does not understand humanity, or humans. She doesn't really understand emotions, she looks at everything in a very technical way. She has had normality training, so she knows how to respond to stuff, and seeing things from her head, and then after observing her from a different character's point of view is really awesome.",GfA_NcwkjmU,7.4,140,163,"I, y'know, for  850 pages general when a book's that long I say uh 'Find yourself a good editor and cut that down.'

It's her very first book and it started a long series and I'm a little late to the party on this.

In between chapters there are short excerpts from either some of the fan-fiction written by Kath or some of the actual like Simon Snow books. Even though most times it feels really unrelated to the rest of the story, somehow it just fits in really well. I have to say I enjoyed the fan-fiction parts a lot more than the actual bits from the Simon Snow books. It's funny how I can identify with Kath, and people who aren't familiar with fan-fiction can kind of identify with the other characters that find it a bit strange, so there's kind of like a different angle for all kinds of readers.",5i0wDhyjXl8,6.1,0,18,"Hoi. This is my combined book and movie review of Carrie by Stephen King. Let's start out with the book. I read the book before the movie. It is quite a short book to read. Actually, I didn't finish the last two chapters before I saw the movie, which I think was quite good cuz it meant that the ending was a bit of a surprise, and then I could go back and read the last two chapters and figure out what happened in the book.",bKnoqnXe4cU,2.4,137,162,"And then of course there was the Dutch aspect. John's spent about three months in Amsterdam last year so he knows what it's like to be in Amsterdam and that is what makes it so legit. For those of you who don't know I'm dutch, I live in the Netherlands. I live about thirty minutes from Amsterdam by train, and I really like the picture that John paints of Amsterdam. You can tell from the book that he really likes it but I think that most of the things that are in there are completely true.",TlRagvTsqOI,8.2,47,72,"and during the night when the maze closes, creatures called Groobers come out, and if you're in the maze and the Groobers come out you'll most likely not survive. As the book goes on you learn more about the maze and you learn more about Thomas' purpose for being in the maze. I'm not gonna go on anymore cuz I feel like I could spoil it so easily, so... That's the gist of the story but I promise you it's way more intense than what I'm saying right now because it kind of just sounds silly. Boys... stuck in a maze, trying to find their way out...",qaqO5nJOnSc,9.2,31,55,"He begins to hear voices in his room and he doesn't really know where they're coming from until he realizes that they're coming from little beetles that are crawling throughout his room.

That's what the book is basically about, let's talk about somethings now... Some things in this book.",avBt9TK6-1c
10.5,108,127,"The plot was so amazing there was so much going on, so many things happening and I almost doubted that the book would tie up everything in the end and that there would probably be this huge cliffhanger and that I'd have to wait for the next book. But that wasn't the case at all. She tied up the book perfectly, and I just can't wait for the next book. I just want it now, I just want it now Victoria Schwab. Can you just give it to me now, huh? How bout that, yea?",AzJ6ypiGGG0,6.2,42,65,"This was Stephen King's first novel, and as you can see it is quite short. It's one of those very familiar stories where most people I think know what happens to Carrie at prom. But what kind of really shocked me was just the mother is so abusive and so just messed up. You don't really expect to feel sorry for Carrie, you think she's the monster, but while you're reading this you're kind of rooting for Carrie.",bKnoqnXe4cU,4.2,46,76,"When I read about this ceremony that was going to happen, where everyone finds their perfect match, I just though to myself, 'let's guess who will not find a perfect partner, there must be some kind of complication.' I wish that there was some kind of dystopian book where, for some reason, the main character fits perfectly into society. There are some complications with Cassia's matching. There are two boys involved, and it's dramatic and I did not care for that part of the storyline whatsoever.",ZIZLyheuu_E,10.2,26,42,"It may sound like an easy task, but it's not. The keepers are faced to deal with histories who are lost and confused and they're often pretty violent. not only is Mackenzie faced with the task of being a keeper, but she's facing moving to a new city, losing her brother and a mystery she feels the need to solve.",AzJ6ypiGGG0,6.5,181,200,"In general I thought that the movie was really fun, it was really interesting to watch, while fun is maybe not the right word. You actually get to see what happens during all the attacks, and you get to be with Carrie. What I really didn't like was the ending. I feel like it was a bit too soft and melodramatic in a way. I really want to watch the older Carrie adaptation as well and see how it compares.",bKnoqnXe4cU

He's quite a bit younger than her and she marries him in 1743. During the whole book we never come back to 1945.",El0MAj7hfDc,3.3,114,146,"There was one thing that I didn't like at all. I hate when dreams and visions are one of the main parts of a book, when a storyline relies very heavily on it. One example of that is A Great and Terrible Beauty. I didn't really like that book purely for that reason. In this book, R eats the brain of Julie's boyfriend, and when the zombies eat brains they get to relive some of the memories of that person. I quite like that idea, but then it starts taking up a larger part of the book, and reality and memory get a bit mixed up, and personally I could've done without that part of the story.",yzzexQxoGvQ,5.1,0,12,"",GfA_NcwkjmU,3.4,179,191,"In the comments you can let me know if you read the book or if you're planning on seeing the movie.
