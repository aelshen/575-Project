The bartender who works at the cocktail lounge is also one of the characters. There is Rachel who I thought was probably most interesting out of all of them. She had a bit of a Sherlock thing going on as in that she's really intelligent, but she just does not understand humanity, or humans.

I really enjoyed the girl in this story, who's called 'Julie'. She's pretty feisty. She's not afraid to kick some ass, she's not a frightened little bird, but she's still a normal girl.

Even though most times it feels really unrelated to the rest of the story, somehow it just fits in really well. I have to say I enjoyed the fan-fiction parts a lot more than the actual bits from the Simon Snow books. It's funny how I can identify with Kath, and people who aren't familiar with fan-fiction can kind of identify with the other characters that find it a bit strange, so there's kind of like a different angle for all kinds of readers.",'FA1JsSytUQE',12.4,134,157,"But here, Camus is able to gradually massage the psychopath elements of Mersault so slowly into the narrative, that when I read it, I was almost halfway into the book before suddenly it clicked into my head... I get it now.",'vFvBXuxI50s',3.4,179,191,"In the comments you can let me know if you read the book or if you're planning on seeing the movie. I'll also put a link to the trailer in the description and I will talk to you guys later. Doei.",'TlRagvTsqOI',1.4,166,190,"One evening I stayed up until 3AM and finished the second half and cried, because there's so many things in it that are so familiar and it's just a wonderful, wonderful book. I can end this video by saying 'Please go buy Fangirl, and please read it.' I will be encouraging everyone I meet to read this book. Also I've mentioned this before but the illustrations on the cover are by Ginger Hayes. I will put a link to her tumblr in the description because she is amazing.",'FA1JsSytUQE'
34.5,140,155,"I think at the time that it was published it definitely would have been considered a thrilling page-turner and to some extent it could still be considered that today. I certainly didn't think it was necessary for him to explain the science behind becoming invisible.",'UktoIcTRHB4',36.5,123,133,"Now, unlike Jane Eyre, Pride and Prejudice did not live up to the hype. To be honest, I found it kind of boring.",'lNyQuF647QA',19.1,0,20,"'Just because the English language gives you the freedom to be malleable with your idea construction doesn't necessarily mean that that liberty should be taken,' so should have said the conscience of author Mark Z.

Today we're going to review The Outlander by Diana Gabaldon. Now I er I assume I am announcing that right, 'Gabaldon'. This is an 850 page fiction work, so this is a novel, and it's actually the first in a whole series of novels, umm that she put out. It's her very first book and it started a long series and I'm a little late to the party on this. This was first publish in 1991 by <unintelligible> Books, and so there's been quite a few since, so I've got some catching up to do in terms of my reading.",'bKnoqnXe4cU',16.4,101,117,"Number 1: is start a logbook. So it's like a diary I think, but slightly shorter, but it doesn't have to be that, it could be anything you want it to be, but the idea is to keep a record of what you do everyday, just so you can look back and piece together I guess the fragments of whatever has led you to become wherever you are.",'R-jzd06vSpU'
6.5,181,200,"In general I thought that the movie was really fun, it was really interesting to watch, while fun is maybe not the right word. You actually get to see what happens during all the attacks, and you get to be with Carrie. What I really didn't like was the ending. I feel like it was a bit too soft and melodramatic in a way. I really want to watch the older Carrie adaptation as well and see how it compares.",'GfA_NcwkjmU',14.4,185,221,"One, tiny tiny tiny tiny downside about this novel: I have absolutely no knowledge of the French language and whenever little Adele, the um little girl that Jane is a governess to, speaks, because she's a french character, all of her dialogue is in French. So I had no idea, throughout the entire novel, what little Adele was saying. Which was kind of annoying. It didn't really detract from the story at all, but you know, it was kind of like uh, they could have put translations somewhere.",'P3IIcCtqqEo',2.5,182,207,"Okay, so here's the too-long-didn't-watch version. The Fault in Our Stars is pretty much amazing, I can recommend this to anyone. It's kind of weird cuz it's not like a fun book you can recommend. There's lots of funny things in it but it's not a fun book, but it is very good. Also, to all of you Dutch <unintelligible> there's going to be some very exciting things happening surrounding The Fault in Our Stars in March, so uh get ready for that.",'5i0wDhyjXl8',35.6,162,165,"So I gave it 2 out of 5 stars.",'TOOU7qyUz-c',34.4,104,129,"Either way I found the country bumpkins dialogue to be incredibly difficult to read because kind of like in the Harry Potter J.K.

6.4,143,164,"What I kind of didn't like as much was the modern setting of it. They bullies were kind of like the sexy, popular girls. They take a video of Carrie and they upload it on youtube and they share it around like that, and what I really liked about the book was the old-fashioned setting. I know that it just wouldn't work for a modern adaptation to be set in that time, so I think obviously they've made the best choice.",'GfA_NcwkjmU',9.3,72,95,"I thought the story overall was really unique and fascinating and it was full of action and suspense and it was just really an exciting book. But the main thing that I have a problem with was the writing style, I didn't really enjoy it, it was kind of hard to follow at times, and it just didn't really think it was very well done, and it kind of caused me not to enjoy the story as much as I would have if it was written better. I'm not saying that this author is a terrible writer, but I think it could have been done better.",'qaqO5nJOnSc',36.7,163,170,"OK, there are way, way way way way way too many characters in this novel.",'lNyQuF647QA',34.2,20,33,"I found the language of this book to be a little frustrating. It's not that it wasn't understandable, but the issue I had was that it seemed like the author was a little prejudiced. First of all, the main character is albino and a serial killer, so what are you trying to say. Hm, Wells?",'UktoIcTRHB4',14.3,158,172,"I must say, if you have this on your shelf and you're kind of reluctant to read it, you know, it's a Bronte, it's over 500 pages long, guys I read this in 3 days.

15.4,111,131,"But the novel is really held together by an absolutely brilliant first person narrator. Crace repeatedly fooled me by thinking that he was doing some clever foreshadowing when, the following chapter I would think, well I know what's gonna happen here, but then actually the narrator would then say, 'what I told you earlier on, well I kind of left out a little bit that was quite important and having found this bit out know, you probably think a little less of me.'",'2QrAtMFLSj0',4.5,210,223,"In the comments you can let me know what you thought about Matched.

Some of the imagery was so over the top. For example Cassia wears a green dress to the ceremony, and then later there's all these references to green, and instead of it just kind of being mentioned that she sees something green or that something is green, it's mentioned over and over again like 'look, that thing is green. Green like the dress I wore.' It was getting to a point where it was slowly getting you embarrassed for reading this in public, because I felt like people knew what kind of book this was.",'yzzexQxoGvQ'
