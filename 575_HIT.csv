They bullies were kind of like the sexy, popular girls. They take a video of Carrie and they upload it on youtube and they share it around like that, and what I really liked about the book was the old-fashioned setting. I know that it just wouldn't work for a modern adaptation to be set in that time, so I think obviously they've made the best choice.",'GfA_NcwkjmU',19.6,187,199,"There's no reason I shouldn't have been able to get through this without feeling as though I didn't waste a little bit of time, unfortunately, I barely got through it.

Maybe you really loved it, tell me what you liked about it, or if you didn't like it tell me what you didn't like.

16.3,73,91,"And in that way the book provided lots of Eureka moments where I was reading along thinking. of course, why have I not done that before. That's a really good idea. That's exactly what I should have been doing for the last, I don't know, 10 or 15 years. So what I thought I'd do is give you my top 3 takeaways. These are the 3 things that I'm doing now that I wasn't doing before I read the book.",'R-jzd06vSpU',19.7,214,223,"Now I assure you I did not spend 600 dollars on this book, I actually paid about 20 for it when it was still in print. Which, yes, is still too much.",'EgC2YG-BRxs',1.1,0,17,"Hoi, this is my review of fangirl by rainbow rowell. It's been out in the US for quite a while now. It was published in the UK last month with a slightly different cover. My book comes with bonus content inside, including illustrations of some of the characters, and a little cartoon in the back which you shouldn't read if you haven't read the book yet, because it's a bit of a spoiler.",'FA1JsSytUQE',13.3,85,102,"This is the most depressing novel I've ever read in my life. I mean I hated every single character, there's not one single real human being in this entire novel.",'GHjV4avE88U',2.1,0,25,"Hoi!  This is a review of the The Fault in Our Stars by John Green. There's probably a lot of you who haven't read it yet, so here's the deal with spoilers. This review is free of any major spoilers. So if you kind know of the basic storyline of the book is, you have absolutely nothing to worry about, but obviously if you don't know anything about this book, and you want to keep it that way, maybe you can save this video to your favorites and come back to it after you finished reading The Fault in Our Stars. I have so many things to say about this book I honestly do not know where to start.",'5i0wDhyjXl8'
5.1,0,12,"",'ZIZLyheuu_E',15.4,111,131,"But the novel is really held together by an absolutely brilliant first person narrator. Crace repeatedly fooled me by thinking that he was doing some clever foreshadowing when, the following chapter I would think, well I know what's gonna happen here, but then actually the narrator would then say, 'what I told you earlier on, well I kind of left out a little bit that was quite important and having found this bit out know, you probably think a little less of me.'",'2QrAtMFLSj0',15.5,148,158,"So all in all, I love the book.

It was quite gripping for a novel set in such a small place without any fireworks and guns going off and stuff like that.",'2QrAtMFLSj0',36.6,147,156,"So I didn't really you know play into the whole chicklet kind of aspect of it. I mean, it is the original chicklet when you think about it.",'lNyQuF647QA',6.1,0,18,"Hoi. This is my combined book and movie review of Carrie by Stephen King. Let's start out with the book. I read the book before the movie. It is quite a short book to read. Actually, I didn't finish the last two chapters before I saw the movie, which I think was quite good cuz it meant that the ending was a bit of a surprise, and then I could go back and read the last two chapters and figure out what happened in the book.",'GfA_NcwkjmU'
35.4,114,132,"I mean, yeah, the writing's good, it's Stephen King so it's bound to be good. But there just seemed to be too many moments in the story that were completely redundant, like for example the custody case, I don't really see what that had to do with anything. It took up a lot of the book, and I didn't see the point in it.",'TOOU7qyUz-c',2.5,182,207,"Okay, so here's the too-long-didn't-watch version. The Fault in Our Stars is pretty much amazing, I can recommend this to anyone. It's kind of weird cuz it's not like a fun book you can recommend. There's lots of funny things in it but it's not a fun book, but it is very good. Also, to all of you Dutch <unintelligible> there's going to be some very exciting things happening surrounding The Fault in Our Stars in March, so uh get ready for that.",'5i0wDhyjXl8',3.3,114,146,"There was one thing that I didn't like at all. I hate when dreams and visions are one of the main parts of a book, when a storyline relies very heavily on it. One example of that is A Great and Terrible Beauty. I didn't really like that book purely for that reason. In this book, R eats the brain of Julie's boyfriend, and when the zombies eat brains they get to relive some of the memories of that person. I quite like that idea, but then it starts taking up a larger part of the book, and reality and memory get a bit mixed up, and personally I could've done without that part of the story.",'TlRagvTsqOI',35.2,44,65,"We have the main character Mike Nunan, a famous writer and also the narrator of the book. Mike's ex-wife dies unexpectedly at the start of the book, and subsequently Mike then finds himself with severe writer's block. Where it's not just that he can't think of anything to write, it's more that he has a physical reaction whenever he tries to write. He gets incredibly sick and nauseous.",'TOOU7qyUz-c',12.1,0,37,"Hey everybody, Dean Goranites here again, and I wanna take you on a magical adventure through the land of books. Todays continent we're gonna visit: psychopaths, murders and death sentences. The Stranger by Albert Camus. By the way, that might not be how you're supposed to pronounce the author's name I'm also gonna have a lot of trouble pronouncing the main character's name. So here's my guess: Merslow? Meer?

To be honest, I found it kind of boring.",'lNyQuF647QA',16.4,101,117,"Number 1: is start a logbook. So it's like a diary I think, but slightly shorter, but it doesn't have to be that, it could be anything you want it to be, but the idea is to keep a record of what you do everyday, just so you can look back and piece together I guess the fragments of whatever has led you to become wherever you are.",'R-jzd06vSpU',34.3,69,85,"Sticking with the theme of other, it's strange that Wells put so much emphasis on how stupid some people are and how intelligent others are. You get a kinda feel for Wells' writing style and his tone and his voice and so on, which is lovely. It's very easy to follow.",'UktoIcTRHB4',6.3,87,122,"My only issue with this is that as soon as it gets to the kind of prom scenes, you get a lot more interviews and descriptions from other people, and what you wanna know is what's going on in Carrie's head, and it just kind of drags out a lot. The first bits of the book were definitely my favorite. Also didn't think that this book was very scary. I think if you hear about Stephen King book, you assume that it's terrifying because of monsters and blood and murder. But actually this book just kind of makes you really sad and angry. So if you really don't like horror or really scary stories, you can still give Carrie a go.",'GfA_NcwkjmU'
